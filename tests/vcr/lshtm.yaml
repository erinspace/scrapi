        D</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description>Introduction: The first-line therapy
        for the intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) is
        sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). There is an urgent need to identify safe,
        well-tolerated and efficacious alternatives to SP due to widespread Plasmodium
        falciparum resistance. Combination therapy using azithromycin and chloroquine
        is one possibility that has demonstrated adequate parasitological response
        &gt; 95% in clinical trials of non-pregnant adults in sub-Saharan Africa and
        where IPTp is a government policy in 33 countries. Areas covered: Key safety,
        tolerability and efficacy data are presented for azithromycin and chloroquine,
        alone and/or in combination, when used to prevent and/or treat P. falciparum,
        P. vivax, and several curable sexually transmitted and reproductive tract
        infections (STI/RTI). Pharmacokinetic evidence from pregnant women is also
        summarized for both compounds. Expert opinion: The azithromycin-chloroquine
        regimen that has demonstrated consistent efficacy in non-pregnant adults has
        been a 3-day course containing daily doses of 1 g of azithromycin and 600
        mg base of chloroquine. The pharmacokinetic evidence of these compounds individually
        suggests that dose adjustments may not be necessary when used in combination
        for treatment efficacy against P. falciparum, P. vivax, as well as several
        curable STI/RTI among pregnant women, although clinical confirmation will
        be necessary. Mass trachoma-treatment campaigns have shown that azithromycin
        selects for macrolide resistance in the pneumococcus, which reverses following
        the completion of therapy. Most importantly, no evidence to date suggests
        that azithromycin induces pneumococcal resistance to penicillin.</dc:description>\n

        at the crossroads of public health policy.</dc:title>\n        <dc:creator>Chico,

        intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
        (SP) has been a key component of the focused antenatal care package for nearly
        a decade, reducing the burden of low birthweight attributable to malaria in
        sub-Saharan Africa. However, SP has lost parasite sensitivity in many sub-Saharan
        locations during the same period, rendering its beneficial effect in IPTp
        debatable. Malaria transmission has also declined in some epidemiological
        settings. There is no evidence to suggest, however, that the risk of malaria
        in pregnancy without preventive measures has declined in the same locations.
        Thus, the urgency to identify efficacious drugs and/or new strategies to prevent
        malaria in pregnancy remains as great as ever. We summarise the results of
        recently published SP-IPTp studies from areas of high drug resistance and/or
        low malaria transmission. We also present the evidence for mefloquine and
        azithromycin-based combinations (ABCs), two leading drug options to replace
        SP in IPTp. We discuss optimal dosing for ABCs and their likely protection
        against several sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections. We
        also summarise data from a diagnosis-based alternative to IPTp known as the
        intermittent screening and treatment (IST) for malaria. Clinical and operational
        research is urgently needed to compare birth outcomes achieved by IPTp with
        ABCs vs. IST using an efficacious antimalarial therapy.</dc:description>\n

        (IPT) against malaria is a malaria control strategy aimed at reducing the
        burden of malaria in certain high-risk groups, namely pregnant women and children.
        Three strategies - IPT in pregnancy (IPTp), infants (IPTi) and children (IPTc)
        - are reviewed here focusing on the mechanism of action, choice of drugs available,
        controversies and future research. Drugs for IPT need to be co-formulated,
        long acting, safe and preferably administered as a single dose. There is no
        obvious replacement for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, the most commonly utilized
        drug combination. All strategies face similar problems of rising drug resistance,
        falling malaria transmission and a policy shift from controlling disease to
        malaria elimination and eradication. IPT is an accepted form of malaria control,
        but to date only IPTp has been adopted as policy.</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Expert

        the high malaria-transmission settings of sub-Saharan Africa, malaria in pregnancy
        is an important cause of maternal, perinatal and neonatal morbidity. Intermittent
        preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
        (SP) reduces the incidence of low birth-weight, pre-term delivery, intrauterine
        growth-retardation and maternal anaemia. However, the public health benefits
        of IPTp are declining due to SP resistance. The combination of azithromycin
        and chloroquine is a potential alternative to SP for IPTp. This review summarizes
        key in vitro and in vivo evidence of azithromycin and chloroquine activity
        against Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, as well as the anticipated
        secondary benefits that may result from their combined use in IPTp, including
        the cure and prevention of many sexually transmitted diseases. Drug costs
        and the necessity for external financing are discussed along with a range
        of issues related to drug resistance and surveillance. Several scientific
        and programmatic questions of interest to policymakers and programme managers
        are also presented that would need to be addressed before azithromycin-chloroquine
        could be adopted for use in IPTp.</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>BioMed

        infections/reproductive tract infections (STIs/RTIs) in pregnancy are direct
        and indirect causes of stillbirth, prematurity, low birth weight, and maternal
        and neonatal morbidity and mortality. \n\nOBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic
        review and meta-analysis of malaria and STI/RTI prevalence estimates among
        pregnant women attending antenatal care facilities in sub-Saharan Africa.
        \n\nDATA SOURCES PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization International
        Clinical Trials Registry, and reference lists were searched for studies reporting
        malaria, syphilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas
        vaginalis, or bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women attending antenatal
        care facilities in sub-Saharan Africa. \n\nSTUDY SELECTION Included studies
        were conducted in 1990-2011 with open enrollment. Studies from South Africa,
        where malaria is no longer endemic, were excluded. \n\nDATA EXTRACTION Point
        prevalence estimates were corrected for diagnostic precision. A random-effects
        model meta-analysis was applied to produce pooled prevalence estimates. \n\nRESULTS
        A total of 171 studies met inclusion criteria, providing 307 point prevalence
        estimates for malaria or STIs/RTIs and including a total of 340 904 women.
        The pooled prevalence estimates (with 95% CIs and number of women with positive
        diagnosis) among studies in 1990-2011 in East and Southern Africa were as
        follows: syphilis, 4.5% (3.9%-5.1%; n = 8346 positive diagnoses), N gonorrhoeae,
        3.7% (2.8%-4.6%; n = 626), C trachomatis, 6.9% (5.1%-8.6%; n = 350), T vaginalis,
        29.1% (20.9%-37.2%; n = 5502), bacterial vaginosis, 50.8% (43.3%-58.4%; n
        = 4280), peripheral malaria, 32.0% (25.9%-38.0%; n = 11 688), and placental
        malaria, 25.8% (19.7%-31.9%; n = 1388). West and Central Africa prevalence
        estimates were as follows: syphilis, 3.5% (1.8%-5.2%; n = 851), N gonorrhoeae,
        2.7% (1.7%-3.7%; n = 73), C trachomatis, 6.1% (4.0%-8.3%; n = 357), T vaginalis,
        17.8% (12.4%-23.1%; n = 822), bacterial vaginosis, 37.6% (18.0%-57.2%; n =
        1208), peripheral malaria, 38.2% (32.3%-44.1%; n = 12 242), and placental
        malaria, 39.9% (34.2%-45.7%; n = 4658). \n\nCONCLUSION The dual prevalence
        of malaria and STIs/RTIs in pregnancy among women who attend antenatal care
        facilities in sub-Saharan Africa is considerable, with the combined prevalence
        of curable STIs/RTIs being equal to, if not greater than, malaria. \n\n</dc:description>\n

        The WHO recommends the administration of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to
        all pregnant women living in areas of moderate (stable) to high malaria transmission
        during scheduled antenatal visits, beginning in the second trimester and continuing
        to delivery. Malaria parasites have lost sensitivity to SP in many endemic
        areas, prompting the investigation of alternatives that include azithromycin-based
        combination (ABC) therapies. Use of ABC therapies may also confer protection
        against curable sexually transmitted infections and reproductive tract infections
        (STIs/RTIs). The magnitude of protection at the population level would depend
        on the efficacy of the azithromycin-based regimen used and the underlying
        prevalence of curable STIs/RTIs among pregnant women who receive preventive
        treatment. This systematic review summarizes the efficacy data of azithromycin
        against curable STIs/RTIs.&lt;br/&gt; </dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Expert

        Vitamin D deficiency is associated with impaired immune responses and increased
        susceptibility to a number of intracellular pathogens in individuals infected
        with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is not known whether such an association
        exists with Cryptococcus neoformans.&lt;br/&gt; METHODS: Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin
        D (25[OH]D) were measured in 150 patients with cryptococcal meningitis (CM)
        and 150 HIV-infected controls in Cape Town, South Africa, and associations
        between vitamin D deficiency and CM were examined. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D
        levels and cryptococcal notifications were analyzed for evidence of reciprocal
        seasonality. Associations between 25(OH)D levels and disease severity, immune
        responses, and microbiological clearance were investigated in the patients
        with CM.&lt;br/&gt; RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency (plasma 25[OH]D \u226450
        nmol/L) was present in 74% of patients. Vitamin D deficiency was not associated
        with CM (adjusted odds ratio, 0.93 [95% confidence interval, .6-1.6]; P =
        .796). Levels of 25(OH)D showed marked seasonality, but no reciprocal seasonality
        was seen in CM notifications. No significant associations were found between
        25(OH)D levels and fungal burden or levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03B1,
        interferon \u03B3, interleukin 6, soluble CD14, or neopterin in cerebrospinal
        fluid. Rates of fungal clearance did not vary according to vitamin D status.&lt;br/&gt;
        CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency does not predispose to the development of
        CM, or lead to impaired immune responses or microbiological clearance in HIV-infected
        patients with CM.&lt;br/&gt; </dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Oxford

        The Old World screwworm (OWS) fly, Chrysomya bezziana, is an obligate parasite
        of livestock, and the myiasis caused by its larval infestations is economically
        important in Indonesia. The current spatial distribution of such a pest depends
        on two main factors: the current environmental conditions in which it can
        survive; and, its ability to occupy those environments by dispersal, which
        can be inferred from phylogeography and population genetics. These indicate
        that all OWS flies in Indonesia have mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) haplotypes
        of the Asian lineage, and the regional separation of its four sub-lineages
        is the result of infrequent long-distance dispersal. We report the first investigation
        to associate regional cyt b sub-lineages of the OWS fly with environmental
        variables. Principal Components Analysis was used to demonstrate that these
        sub-lineages are associated with very similar macro-climates throughout Indonesia.
        Then, a species distribution model for the OWS fly in Indonesia was obtained
        by using the Maxent program. This indicated that elevation captured information
        not given by other environmental variables, and cattle density provided the
        most useful information by itself. The results of our study provide some important
        leads for future research, which will require better, stratified sampling.&lt;br/&gt;

        prevalence in South Africa - an ecological study.</dc:title>\n        <dc:creator>Kenyon,

        J</dc:creator>\n        <dc:creator>Chico, RM</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description>BACKGROUND
        Prevalence estimates of various bacterial sexually transmitted infections
        in South Africa have declined considerably since the mid-1990s. Syphilis among
        pregnant women, for example, declined from 10.8% in 1998 to 2.8% in 2001.
        \n\nMETHODS Pearson's correlation coefficients were estimated for association
        between the prevalence of syphilis/male urethral discharge/male genital ulcers
        and the peak HIV prevalence at a district and provincial level in the early
        and late phases of the HIV epidemic in South Africa. \n\nRESULTS Prevalence
        estimates of syphilis, male urethral discharge and male genital ulcers during
        the period preceding the peak HIV prevalence were all positively correlated
        with the peak HIV prevalence at a provincial level (Pearson's correlation
        coefficient [r]\u2009=\u20090.83, p\u2009=\u20090.006; r\u2009=\u20090.66,
        p\u2009=\u20090.052; r\u2009=\u20090.79, 0.011, respectively). These relationships
        all switched to a negative association later in the HIV epidemic at a provincial
        level (r\u2009=\u2009-0.53, p\u2009=\u20090.14; r\u2009=\u2009-0.73, p\u2009=\u20090.130;
        r\u2009=\u2009-0.54, p\u2009=\u20090.027, respectively). \n\nCONCLUSION AIDS
        mortality may have played an important role in the decline of bacterial sexually
        transmitted infections such as syphilis in this region. Consequently, the
        relatively recent scale-up of antiretroviral therapy may result in a resurgence
        of syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections as observed in high-income
        countries. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>SAGE Publications</dc:publisher>\n

        role in the decline in syphilis prevalence in the USA, but its effect on the
        dramatic reduction in syphilis prevalence in Southern and Eastern Africa has
        not been explored. In this ecological study, we investigated the extent to
        which the relationship between syphilis and HIV prevalence at a population
        level varied between the early and late periods of the HIV epidemic. \n\n
        We performed linear regression analysis to measure the association between
        the national prevalence of syphilis and the peak-HIV prevalence in the early
        and late phases of the HIV epidemic in 11 countries of Southern and Eastern
        Africa. \n\n Our analysis showed a strong positive association between peak-HIV
        prevalence and syphilis prevalence early in the HIV epidemic (R(2)=0.59; p=0.006).
        Although only of borderline statistical significance, this linear relationship
        between HIV prevalence and syphilis prevalence switched to a negative direction
        late in the HIV epidemic (R(2)=0.32; p=0.07). \n\n AIDS mortality may have
        played an important role in the decline in syphilis in this region. Consequently,
        with AIDS deaths declining in Sub-Saharan Africa, vigilant surveillance of
        syphilis prevalence will be necessary to detect a potential re-emergence,
        as has occurred in high-income countries, and to render a timely public health
        response. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher>\n

        Despite advances in treatment, survival from acute lymphoblastic leukemia
        (ALL) remains lower among non-White children than White children in the US.
        We investigated the association of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status
        (SES) with survival.&lt;br/&gt; PROCEDURES: We analyzed 9,295 Californian
        children (3,251 Whites, 4,890 Hispanics, 796 Asians, and 358 Blacks) aged
        \u226419 years diagnosed with a first primary ALL during 1988-2011. We used
        the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival at 1, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis
        for three calendar periods. Hazard ratios of death for race/ethnicity, SES,
        and clinical factors were estimated by Cox regression models.&lt;br/&gt; RESULTS:
        Median follow-up time was 7.4 years (range 0-25 years). Over time, survival
        after ALL improved steadily, but inequalities persisted across races/ethnicities.
        Five-year survival (95% confidence interval) was 85.0% (83.6-86.2) for White,
        81.4% (78.3-84.0) for Asian, 79.0% (77.8-80.2) for Hispanic, and 74.4% (69.4-78.8)
        for Black children. In multivariable-adjusted models, the hazard of death
        was increased by 57% among Black, 38% among Hispanic, and 33% among Asian
        children compared with White children. Patients residing in the lowest SES
        neighborhoods at diagnosis had a 39% increased risk of death relative to those
        living in higher SES neighborhoods.&lt;br/&gt; CONCLUSION: Despite significant
        improvements in survival, non-White children and children residing in low
        SES neighborhoods experienced worse survival even after adjusting for potential
        confounders. Our findings highlight the need to capture specific information
        on disease biology, treatment, and treatment adherence to better understand
        the predictors of lower survival in minority and low SES groups. Pediatr Blood

        Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy is a highly cost-effective
        intervention which significantly improves maternal and birth outcomes among
        mothers and their newborns who live in areas of moderate to high malaria transmission.
        However, coverage in sub-Saharan Africa remains unacceptably low, calling
        for urgent action to increase uptake dramatically and maximize its public
        health impact. The 'Global Call to Action' outlines priority actions that
        will pave the way to success in achieving national and international coverage
        targets. Immediate action is needed from national health institutions in malaria
        endemic countries, the donor community, the research community, members of
        the pharmaceutical industry and private sector, along with technical partners
        at the global and local levels, to protect pregnant women and their babies
        from the preventable, adverse effects of malaria in pregnancy. \n\n</dc:description>\n

        R</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description>: In a nested case-control study,
        controls are selected for each case from the individuals who are at risk at
        the time at which the case occurs. We say that the controls are matched on
        study time. To adjust for possible confounding, it is common to match on other
        variables as well. The standard analysis of nested case-control data is based
        on a partial likelihood which compares the covariates of each case to those
        of its matched controls. It has been suggested that one may break the matching
        of nested case-control data and analyse them as case-cohort data using an
        inverse probability weighted (IPW) pseudo likelihood. Further, when some covariates
        are available for all individuals in the cohort, multiple imputation (MI)
        makes it possible to use all available data in the cohort. In the paper we
        review the standard method and the IPW and MI approaches, and compare their
        performance using simulations that cover a range of scenarios, including one
        and two endpoints.&lt;br/&gt; </dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Springer

        \       <dc:title>Designing Psychological Treatments for Scalability: The
        PREMIUM Approach.</dc:title>\n        <dc:creator>Vellakkal, S</dc:creator>\n
        \       <dc:creator>Patel, V</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description> Lack of
        access to empirically-supported psychological treatments (EPT) that are contextually
        appropriate and feasible to deliver by non-specialist health workers (referred
        to as 'counsellors') are major barrier for the treatment of mental health
        problems in resource poor countries. To address this barrier, the 'Program
        for Effective Mental Health Interventions in Under-resourced Health Systems'
        (PREMIUM) designed a method for the development of EPT for severe depression
        and harmful drinking. This was implemented over three years in India. This
        study assessed the relative usefulness and costs of the five 'steps' (Systematic
        reviews, In-depth interviews, Key informant surveys, Workshops with international
        experts, and Workshops with local experts) in the first phase of identifying
        the strategies and theoretical model of the treatment and two 'steps' (Case
        series with specialists, and Case series and pilot trial with counsellors)
        in the second phase of enhancing the acceptability and feasibility of its
        delivery by counsellors in PREMIUM with the aim of arriving at a parsimonious
        set of steps for future investigators to use for developing scalable EPT.
        \n\n The study used two sources of data: the usefulness ratings by the investigators
        and the resource utilization. The usefulness of each of the seven steps was
        assessed through the ratings by the investigators involved in the development
        of each of the two EPT, viz. Healthy Activity Program for severe depression
        and Counselling for Alcohol Problems for harmful drinking. Quantitative responses
        were elicited to rate the utility (usefulness/influence), followed by open-ended
        questions for explaining the rankings. The resources used by PREMIUM were
        computed in terms of time (months) and monetary costs. \n\n The theoretical
        core of the new treatments were consistent with those of EPT derived from
        global evidence, viz. Behavioural Activation and Motivational Enhancement
        for severe depression and harmful drinking respectively, indicating the universal
        applicability of these theories. All the steps of both phases in PREMIUM contributed
        to the development of the final EPT. However, if there were significant resource
        constraints, the steps can be limited to workshops with international and
        local experts in the first phase, and case series with specialists, and case
        series and pilot trial with counsellors in the second phase. \n\n Integrating
        global evidence with local knowledge and practices are complementary and feasible
        goals to contribute to the development of contextually appropriate and feasible
        EPT in resource poor country settings. The emerging EPT share similar theoretical
        frameworks to those described in the global evidence. The PREMIUM method has
        relevance for any setting where populations have poor access to EPT as its
        explicit goal is to develop scalable treatments. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Public

        RH</dc:creator>\n        <dc:creator>Keegan, TH</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description>BACKGROUND:
        Findings from clinical trials and population-based studies have differed with
        regard to whether mortality within 30 days of diagnosis (early death) of acute
        promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has decreased in the era of all-trans retinoic
        acid and anthracycline-based chemotherapy.&lt;br/&gt; METHODS: Using data
        from the California Cancer Registry, the authors investigated 7-day and 30-day
        mortality and survival in 772 patients who were aged birth to 39 years when
        they were diagnosed with APL during 1988 to 2011. Logistic regression and
        Cox proportional models were used to examine the association of early death
        and survival, respectively, with sociodemographic and clinical factors.&lt;br/&gt;
        RESULTS: The overall 30-day mortality decreased significantly over time, from
        26% (1988-1995) to 14% (2004-2011) (P =.004). On multivariable analysis, the
        odds of 30-day mortality were 3 times as high during 1988 through 1995 than
        2004 through 2011 (P =.001). However, 7-day mortality did not improve over
        time (P =.229). When patients who died within 7 days of diagnosis were excluded,
        the 30-day mortality during 1996 to 2011 was 3% to 8%, which is similar to
        levels reported in clinical trials. Higher early death and lower survival
        were associated with a lack of health insurance (1996-2011) (early death odds
        ratio, 2.67; P =.031) and Hispanic race/ethnicity (early death odds ratio,
        2.13; P =.014). Early death was not found to be associated with age, sex,
        socioeconomic status, or hospital type. Black patients also experienced worse
        survival.&lt;br/&gt; CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study revealed
        a decreased 30-day mortality during the all-trans retinoic acid era, but 7-day
        mortality remained high. Efforts to achieve equal outcomes in young patients
        with APL should focus on improving access to effective treatment, mainly among
        uninsured patients and those of Hispanic and black race/ethnicity. Cancer

        To evaluate the association between length of residence in an urban area and
        obesity among Peruvian rural-to-urban migrants. \n\n Cross-sectional database
        analysis of the migrant group from the PERU MIGRANT Study (2007). Exposure
        was length of urban residence, analysed as both a continuous (10-year units)
        and a categorical variable. Four skinfold site measurements (biceps, triceps,
        subscapular and suprailiac) were used to calculate body fat percentage and
        obesity (body fat percentage &gt;25% males, &gt;33% females). We used Poisson
        generalized linear models to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios and 95 %
        confidence intervals. Multicollinearity between age and length of urban residence
        was assessed using conditional numbers and correlation tests. \n\n A peri-urban
        shantytown in the south of Lima, Peru. \n\n Rural-to-urban migrants (n 526)
        living in Lima. \n\n Multivariable analyses showed that for each 10-year unit
        increase in residence in an urban area, rural-to-urban migrants had, on average,
        a 12 % (95 % CI 6, 18 %) higher prevalence of obesity. This association was
        also present when length of urban residence was analysed in categories. Sensitivity
        analyses, conducted with non-migrant groups, showed no evidence of an association
        between 10-year age units and obesity in rural (P=0\xB7159) or urban populations
        (P=0\xB7078). High correlation and a large conditional number between age
        and length of urban residence were found, suggesting a strong collinearity
        between both variables. \n\n Longer lengths of urban residence are related
        to increased obesity in rural-to-urban migrant populations; therefore, interventions
        to prevent obesity in urban areas may benefit from targeting migrant groups.

        Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions are amongst the most crucial
        in humanitarian crises, although the impact of the different WASH interventions
        on health outcomes remains unclear. \n\n To examine the quantity and quality
        of evidence on WASH interventions on health outcomes in humanitarian crises,
        as well as evaluate current evidence on their effectiveness against health
        outcomes in these contexts. \n\n A systematic literature review was conducted
        of primary and grey quantitative literature on WASH interventions measured
        against health outcomes in humanitarian crises occurring from 1980-2014. Populations
        of interest were those in resident in humanitarian settings, with a focus
        on acute crisis and early recovery stages of humanitarian crises in low and
        middle-income countries. Interventions of interest were WASH-related, while
        outcomes of interest were health-related. Study quality was assessed via STROBE/CONSORT
        criteria. Results were analyzed descriptively, and PRISMA reporting was followed.
        \n\n Of 3963 studies initially retrieved, only 6 published studies measured
        a statistically significant change in health outcome as a result of a WASH
        intervention. All 6 studies employed point-of-use (POU) water quality interventions,
        with 50% using safe water storage (SWS) and 35% using household water treatment
        (HWT). All 6 studies used self-reported diarrhea outcomes, 2 studies also
        reported laboratory confirmed outcomes, and 2 studies reported health treatment
        outcomes (e.g. clinical admissions). 1 study measured WASH intervention success
        in relation to both health and water quality outcomes; 1 study recorded uptake
        (use of soap) as well as health outcomes. 2 studies were unblinded randomized-controlled
        trials, while 4 were uncontrolled longitudinal studies. 2 studies were graded
        as providing high quality evidence; 3 studies provided moderate and 1 study
        low quality evidence. \n\n The current evidence base on the impact of WASH
        interventions on health outcomes in humanitarian crises is extremely limited,
        and numerous methodological limitations limit the ability to determine associative,
        let alone causal, relationships. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Public

        is a continent with a large burden of both infectious and non-communicable
        diseases. If we are to move forward as a continent, we need to equip our growing
        cadre of exceptional young scientists with the skills needed to tackle the
        diseases endemic to this continent. For this, immunology is among the key
        disciplines. Africans should be empowered to study and understand the diseases
        that affect them, and to perform their cutting-edge research in their country
        of origin. This requires amultifaceted approach, with buy-in from funders,
        overseas partners and perhaps, most important of all, African governments
        themselves.</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Wiley</dc:publisher>\n

        Malaria continues to be a major health problem in low-income countries. Consequently,
        malaria control remains a public health priority in endemic countries such
        as Zambia. Pregnant women and children under 5\_years of age are among groups
        at high risk of malaria infection. Malaria infection is associated with adverse
        birth outcomes that affect the mother, foetus, and infant. Infection with
        HIV has been shown to increase the risk of malaria infection in pregnancy.
        The prevalence and the predictors of malaria infection among pregnant women
        resident in the Nchelenge District of northern Zambia were investigated. \n\n
        Between November 2013 and April 2014, pregnant women in the catchment areas
        of two health centres were recruited during their first antenatal care visit.
        HIV testing was conducted as part of routine care. In addition, blood samples
        were collected from 1086 participants and tested for malaria infection using
        standard microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques specific
        for Plasmodium falciparum. Multivariate logistic regression were conducted
        to examine the predictors of malaria infection. \n\n The prevalence of malaria
        identified by microscopy was 31.8\_% (95\_% confidence intervals [CI], 29.0-34.5;
        N\_=\_1079) and by PCR was 57.8\_% (95\_% CI, 54.9-60.8; N\_=\_1074). HIV
        infection was 13.2\_% among women on their first antenatal visit; the prevalence
        of malaria detected by PCR among HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women was
        56.7\_% (531/936) and 65.2\_% (90/138), respectively. In the final model,
        the risk of malaria infection was 81\_% higher among pregnant women recruited
        from Nchelenge health centre compared to those attending the Kashikishi health
        centre (adjusted odds ratio\_=\_1.81; 95\_% CI, 1.38-2.37, P\_&lt;\_0.001),
        and HIV-infected women across health centres had a 46\_% greater risk of malaria
        infection compared to HIV-uninfected women (adjusted odds ratio\_=\_1.46;
        95\_%, 1.00-2.13, P\_=\_0.045). \n\n High burden of malaria detected by PCR
        in these pregnant women suggests that past prevention efforts have had limited
        effect. To reduce this burden of malaria sustainably, there is clear need
        to strengthen existing interventions and, possibly, to change approaches so
        as to improve targeting of groups most affected by malaria. \n\n</dc:description>\n

        Alcohol use is a global public health problem, including as a risk factor
        for HIV infection, but few data are available on the epidemiology of alcohol
        use and alcohol use disorders (AUD) among young people in sub-Saharan Africa.
        \n\n We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 4 groups of young people
        aged 15-24 years old (secondary school students, college/university students,
        employees of local industries and casual labourers) in two regions (Kilimanjaro
        and Mwanza) of northern Tanzania. Using a multistage stratified random sampling
        strategy, we collected information on demographics, alcohol use, and behavioural
        factors. We screened severity of alcohol use using the Alcohol Use Disorder
        Identification Test (AUDIT) and estimated the quantity and frequency of alcohol
        consumption using the timeline-follow-back-calendar (TLFB) method. \n\n A
        total of 1954 young people were surveyed. The prevalence of reported alcohol
        use was higher among males (47-70% ever users and 20-45% current users) than
        females (24-54% ever users and 12-47% current users). Prevalence of use was
        substantially higher in Kilimanjaro than Mwanza region. In both regions, participants
        reported high exposure to alcohol advertisements, and wide alcohol availability.
        College students reported the highest prevalence of current alcohol use (45%
        among males; 26% among females) and of heavy episodic drinking (71% among
        males; 27% among females) followed by casual labourers. Males were more likely
        to have AUD (an AUDIT score \u22658) than females, with 11-28% of males screening
        positive for AUD. Alcohol use was associated with male gender, being in a
        relationship, greater disposable income, non-Muslim religion and a higher
        number of sexual partners. \n\n Alcohol use is a significant problem among
        young people in northern Tanzania. There is an urgent need to develop, pilot
        and deliver interventions to help young people delay initiation and reduce
        levels of harmful drinking, particularly among college students and casual
        labourers. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Public Library of

        Luco, MS</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description> Mentoring experiences and
        programmes are becoming increasingly recognised as important by those engaged
        in capacity strengthening in global health research. Using a primarily qualitative
        study design, we studied three experiences of mentorship and eight mentorship
        programmes for early career global health researchers based in high-income
        and low- and middle-income countries. For the latter, we drew upon programme
        materials, existing unpublished data and more formal mixed-method evaluations,
        supplemented by individual email questionnaire responses. Research team members
        wrote stories, and the team assembled and analysed them for key themes. Across
        the diverse experiences and programmes, key emergent themes included: great
        mentors inspire others in an inter-generational cascade, mentorship is transformative
        in personal and professional development and involves reciprocity, and finding
        the right balance in mentoring relationships and programmes includes responding
        creatively to failure. Among the challenges encountered were: struggling for
        more level playing fields for new health researchers globally, changing mindsets
        in institutions that do not have a culture of mentorship and building collaboration
        not competition. Mentoring networks spanning institutions and countries using
        multiple virtual and face-to-face methods are a potential avenue for fostering
        organisational cultures supporting quality mentorship in global health research.

        and prevent vascular events, but their net effects in people at low risk of
        vascular events remain uncertain. \n\nMETHODS This meta-analysis included
        individual participant data from 22 trials of statin versus control (n=134,537;
        mean LDL cholesterol difference 1\xB708 mmol/L; median follow-up 4\xB78 years)
        and five trials of more versus less statin (n=39,612; difference 0\xB751 mmol/L;
        5\xB71 years). Major vascular events were major coronary events (ie, non-fatal
        myocardial infarction or coronary death), strokes, or coronary revascularisations.
        Participants were separated into five categories of baseline 5-year major
        vascular event risk on control therapy (no statin or low-intensity statin)
        (&amp;lt;5%, \u22655% to &amp;lt;10%, \u226510% to &amp;lt;20%, \u226520%
        to &amp;lt;30%, \u226530%); in each, the rate ratio (RR) per 1\xB70 mmol/L
        LDL cholesterol reduction was estimated. \n\nFINDINGS Reduction of LDL cholesterol
        with a statin reduced the risk of major vascular events (RR 0\xB779, 95% CI
        0\xB777-0\xB781, per 1\xB70 mmol/L reduction), largely irrespective of age,
        sex, baseline LDL cholesterol or previous vascular disease, and of vascular
        and all-cause mortality. The proportional reduction in major vascular events
        was at least as big in the two lowest risk categories as in the higher risk
        categories (RR per 1\xB70 mmol/L reduction from lowest to highest risk: 0\xB762
        [99% CI 0\xB747-0\xB781], 0\xB769 [99% CI 0\xB760-0\xB779], 0\xB779 [99% CI
        0\xB774-0\xB785], 0\xB781 [99% CI 0\xB777-0\xB786], and 0\xB779 [99% CI 0\xB774-0\xB784];
        trend p=0\xB704), which reflected significant reductions in these two lowest
        risk categories in major coronary events (RR 0\xB757, 99% CI 0\xB736-0\xB789,
        p=0\xB70012, and 0\xB761, 99% CI 0\xB750-0\xB774, p&amp;lt;0\xB70001) and
        in coronary revascularisations (RR 0\xB752, 99% CI 0\xB735-0\xB775, and 0\xB763,
        99% CI 0\xB751-0\xB779; both p&amp;lt;0\xB70001). For stroke, the reduction
        in risk in participants with 5-year risk of major vascular events lower than
        10% (RR per 1\xB70 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 0\xB776, 99% CI 0\xB761-0\xB795,
        p=0\xB70012) was also similar to that seen in higher risk categories (trend
        p=0\xB73). In participants without a history of vascular disease, statins
        reduced the risks of vascular (RR per 1\xB70 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction
        0\xB785, 95% CI 0\xB777-0\xB795) and all-cause mortality (RR 0\xB791, 95%
        CI 0\xB785-0\xB797), and the proportional reductions were similar by baseline
        risk. There was no evidence that reduction of LDL cholesterol with a statin
        increased cancer incidence (RR per 1\xB70 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction
        1\xB700, 95% CI 0\xB796-1\xB704), cancer mortality (RR 0\xB799, 95% CI 0\xB793-1\xB706),
        or other non-vascular mortality. \n\nINTERPRETATION In individuals with 5-year
        risk of major vascular events lower than 10%, each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL
        cholesterol produced an absolute reduction in major vascular events of about
        11 per 1000 over 5 years. This benefit greatly exceeds any known hazards of
        statin therapy. Under present guidelines, such individuals would not typically
        be regarded as suitable for LDL-lowering statin therapy. The present report
        suggests, therefore, that these guidelines might need to be reconsidered.

        falciparum replicates within erythrocytes, producing progeny merozoites that
        are released from infected cells via a poorly understood process called egress.
        The most abundant merozoite surface protein, MSP1, is synthesized as a large
        precursor that undergoes proteolytic maturation by the parasite protease SUB1
        just prior to egress. The function of MSP1 and its processing are unknown.
        Here we show that SUB1-mediated processing of MSP1 is important for parasite
        viability. Processing modifies the secondary structure of MSP1 and activates
        its capacity to bind spectrin, a molecular scaffold protein that is the major
        component of the host erythrocyte cytoskeleton. Parasites expressing an inefficiently
        processed MSP1 mutant show delayed egress, and merozoites lacking surface-bound
        MSP1 display a severe egress defect. Our results indicate that interactions
        between SUB1-processed merozoite surface MSP1 and the spectrin network of
        the erythrocyte cytoskeleton facilitate host erythrocyte rupture to enable
        parasite egress. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher>\n

        early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, represent a key potential HIV-prevention
        approach. Currently, in MSM in the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 36%
        are diagnosed by 1 year from infection, and the ART initiation threshold is
        at CD4 cell count 350/\u03BCl. We investigated what would be required to reduce
        HIV incidence in MSM to below 1 per 1000 person-years (i.e. &lt;535 new infections
        per year) by 2030, and whether this is likely to be cost-effective. \n\n A
        dynamic, individual-based simulation model was calibrated to multiple data
        sources on HIV in MSM in the United Kingdom. Outcomes were projected according
        to future alternative HIV testing and ART initiation scenarios to 2030, considering
        also potential changes in levels of condomless sex. \n\n For ART use to result
        in an incidence of close to 1/1000 person-years requires the proportion of
        all HIV-positive MSM with viral suppression to increase from below 60% currently
        to 90%, assuming no rise in levels of condomless sex. Substantial increases
        in HIV testing, such that over 90% of men are diagnosed within a year of infection,
        would increase the proportion of HIV-positive men with viral suppression to
        80%, and it would be 90%, if ART is initiated at diagnosis. The scenarios
        required for such a policy to be cost-effective are presented. \n\n This analysis
        provides targets for the proportion of all HIV-positive MSM with viral suppression
        required to achieve substantial reductions in HIV incidence. \n\n</dc:description>\n

        S</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description> Adiposity in childhood is associated
        with later cardiovascular disease (CVD), but it is unclear whether this relationship
        is independent of other risk factors experienced in later life, such as smoking
        and hypertension. Carotid-intima media thickness (cIMT) is a measure of subclinical
        atherosclerosis that may be used to assess CVD risk in young people. The aim
        of this study was to examine the relationship between adiposity and cIMT in
        children and adolescents. \n\n We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health,
        and CINAHL Plus electronic databases (1980-2014). Population-based observational
        studies that reported a measure of association between objectively-measured
        adiposity and cIMT in childhood were included in this review. \n\n Twenty-two
        cross-sectional studies were included (n\u2009=\u20097,366 children and adolescents).
        Thirteen of nineteen studies conducted in adolescent populations (mean age
        \u226512\_years, n\u2009=\u20095,986) reported positive associations between
        cIMT and adiposity measures (correlation coefficients 0.13 to 0.59). Three
        studies of pre-adolescent populations (n\u2009=\u20091,380) reported mixed
        evidence, two studies finding no evidence of a correlation, and one an inverse
        relationship between skinfolds and cIMT. Included studies did not report an
        adiposity threshold for subclinical atherosclerosis. \n\n Based on studies
        conducted mostly in Western Europe and the US, adiposity does not appear to
        be associated with cIMT in pre-adolescents, but may be associated in adolescents.
        If further studies confirm these findings, a focus on cardiovascular disease
        prevention efforts in pre-adolescence, before arterial changes have emerged,
        may be justified. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>BioMed Central</dc:publisher>\n

        Since 2010, countries in the African meningitis belt have been introducing
        a new serogroup A meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenAfriVac(\xAE)) through
        mass campaigns. With the subsequent decline in meningitis due to Neisseria
        meningitidis serogroup A (NmA) and relative increase in meningitis due to
        other serogroups, mainly N. meningitidis serogroup W (NmW), the World Health
        Organisation (WHO) initiated a review of the incidence thresholds that guide
        response to meningitis epidemics in the African meningitis belt. \n\n Meningitis
        surveillance data from African meningitis belt countries from 2002 to 2013
        were used to construct a single NmW dataset. The performance of different
        weekly attack rates, used as thresholds to initiate vaccination response,
        on preventing further cases was estimated. The cumulative seasonal attack
        rate used to define an epidemic was also varied. \n\n Considerable variation
        in effect at different thresholds was observed. In predicting epidemics defined
        as a seasonal cumulative incidence of 100/10(5) population, an epidemic threshold
        of 10 cases/10(5) population/week performed well. Based on this same epidemic
        threshold, with a 6 week interval between crossing the epidemic threshold
        and population protection from a meningococcal vaccination campaign, an estimated
        17 cases per event would be prevented by vaccination. Lowering the threshold
        increased the number of cases per event potentially prevented, as did shortening
        the response interval. If the interval was shortened to 4 weeks at the threshold
        of 10/10(5), the number of cases prevented would increase to 54 per event.
        \n\n Accelerating time to vaccination could prevent more cases per event than
        lowering the threshold. Once the meningitis epidemic threshold is crossed,
        it is of critical importance that vaccination campaigns, where appropriate,
        are initiated rapidly. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher>\n

        therapy (ART) on herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) replication is unclear.
        The aim of this study was to assess factors associated with cervico-vaginal
        HSV-2 DNA shedding and genital ulcer disease (GUD) in a cohort of women living
        with HIV-1 in Burkina Faso.&lt;br/&gt; METHODS: \u2003Participants were screened
        for cervico-vaginal HSV-2 DNA, GUD, cervico-vaginal and systemic HIV-1 RNA
        and reproductive tract infections every 3-6 months over 8 years. Associations
        with HSV-2 shedding and quantity were examined using random effects logistic
        and linear regression, respectively.&lt;br/&gt; RESULTS: \u2003Of the 236
        women with data on HSV-2 shedding, 151 took ART during the study period. Cervico-vaginal
        HSV-2 DNA was detected in 42% (99/236) of women in 8.2% of visits (151/1848).
        ART was associated with a reduction in HSV-2 shedding which declined for each
        year on ART (odds ratio [OR]=0.74; 95%CI, 0.59-0.92). In the multivariable
        model, the impact of ART was primarily associated with suppression of systemic
        HIV-1 RNA (aOR=0.32; 95%CI, 0.15-0.67). A reduction in GUD was also observed
        while on ART, mainly in those with HIV-1 viral suppression (aOR=0.53; 95%CI,
        0.25-1.11).&lt;br/&gt; CONCLUSIONS: \u2003ART is strongly associated with
        a decrease in cervico-vaginal HSV-2 shedding, and the impact was sustained
        over several years.&lt;br/&gt; </dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Oxford

        \       <dc:title>\"How I Floated on Gentle Webs of Being\": Psychiatrists
        Stories About the Mental Health Treatment Gap in Africa.</dc:title>\n        <dc:creator>Cooper,
        S</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description> A strong movement has emerged recently
        which is highlighting the high levels of untreated mental illness in Africa
        and making proposals for reducing this 'gap' in mental health care. This movement
        has been criticised for insufficiently attending to the epistemologies embedded
        in its recommendations, and inadequately considering the views of practitioners
        'on the ground'. Employing a narrative-based approach, I accessed the stories
        about the mental health 'treatment gap' of 28 psychiatrists all working clinically
        in public mental health care settings in South Africa, Uganda, Nigeria or
        Ethiopia. Rather than focusing on the content of these stories, I was more
        interested in their underpinning meaning-codes and epistemological politics.
        Dominant thinking about the 'treatment gap' was heavily informed by a biomedical
        paradigm, and associated epistemological order of European Colonial Modernity.
        There were, however, cracks in this master narrative, which crystalised in
        the stories that were told by three particular psychiatrists. Their narratives
        operated within an alternative paradigm, one which appears to be informed
        by the tradition of phenomenology, and in particular the ideas associated
        with French philosopher Merleau-Ponty. This more marginalised thinking may
        offer important insights into reducing the mental health 'treatment gap' in
        Africa in ways very different from those created by current seats of power.

        access HIV care. For HIV-infected children who survive infancy undiagnosed,
        diagnosis usually occurs on presentation to health care services. We investigated
        the effectiveness of routine opt-out HIV testing (ROOT) compared to conventional
        opt-in provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) for children attending
        primary care clinics. \n\n Following an evaluation of PITC services for children
        aged 6 to 15 years in six primary health care facilities in Harare, Zimbabwe,
        ROOT was introduced through a combinations of interventions. The change in
        the proportion of eligible children offered and receiving HIV tests, reasons
        for not testing, and yield of HIV positive diagnoses were compared between
        the two HIV testing strategies. Adjusted risk ratios for having an HIV test
        in the ROOT compared to the PITC period were calculated. \n\n There were 2831
        and 7842 children eligible for HIV testing before and after the introduction
        of ROOT. The proportion of eligible children offered testing increased from
        76% to 93% and test uptake improved from 71% to 95% in the ROOT compared to
        the PITC period. The yield of HIV diagnoses increased from 2.9% to 4.5%, and
        a child attending the clinics post intervention had a 1.99 increased adjusted
        risk (95% CI 1.85-2.14) of receiving an HIV test in the ROOT period compared
        to the pre-intervention period. \n\n ROOT increased the proportion of children
        undergoing HIV-testing, resulting in an overall increased yield of positive
        diagnoses, compared to PITC. ROOT provides an effective approach to reduce
        missed HIV diagnosis in this age-group.This is an open access article distributed

        The Ebola outbreak that started in late 2013 is by far the largest and most
        sustained in history. It occurred in a part of the world where pre-existing
        health systems were already fragile, and these deteriorated further during
        the epidemic due to a large number of health worker deaths; temporary or permanent
        closure of health facilities; non-payment of health workers; intrinsic fear
        of contracting or being stigmatised by Ebola among the population, which negatively
        influenced health-seeking behaviour; enforced quarantine of Ebola-affected
        communities, restricting the access of vulnerable individuals to health facilities;
        and late response by the international community. There are also reports of
        drug and consumable stockouts due to deficiencies in the procurement and supply
        chain as a result of overriding Ebola-related priorities. Providing tuberculosis
        (TB) care and achieving favourable treatment outcomes require a fully functioning
        health system, accurate patient tracking and high patient adherence to treatment.
        Furthermore, as Ebola is easily transmitted through body fluids, the use of
        needles-essential for TB diagnosis and treatment-needs to be avoided during
        an outbreak. We highlight ways in which a sustained Ebola outbreak could jeopardise
        TB activities and suggest pre-emptive preventive measures while awaiting operational
        research evidence. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>International

        S</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description> Between September 2014 and February
        2015, the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases reported in Sierra Leone
        declined in many districts. During this period, a major international response
        was put in place, with thousands of treatment beds introduced alongside other
        infection control measures. However, assessing the impact of the response
        is challenging, as several factors could have influenced the decline in infections,
        including behavior changes and other community interventions. We developed
        a mathematical model of EVD transmission, and measured how transmission changed
        over time in the 12 districts of Sierra Leone with sustained transmission
        between June 2014 and February 2015. We used the model to estimate how many
        cases were averted as a result of the introduction of additional treatment
        beds in each area. Examining epidemic dynamics at the district level, we estimated
        that 56,600 (95% credible interval: 48,300-84,500) Ebola cases (both reported
        and unreported) were averted in Sierra Leone up to February 2, 2015 as a direct
        result of additional treatment beds being introduced. We also found that if
        beds had been introduced 1 month earlier, a further 12,500 cases could have
        been averted. Our results suggest the unprecedented local and international
        response led to a substantial decline in EVD transmission during 2014-2015.
        In particular, the introduction of beds had a direct impact on reducing EVD
        cases in Sierra Leone, although the effect varied considerably between districts.

        of HIV testing and counselling (HTC) strategies in children and adolescents
        (5 to 19 years) in sub-Saharan Africa. \n\n An electronic search was conducted
        in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and conference abstract databases. Studies
        reporting on HTC acceptability, yield and prevalence and published between
        January 2004 and September 2014 were included. Pooled proportions for these
        three outcomes were estimated using a random effects model. A quality assessment
        was conducted on included studies. \n\n A total of 16,380 potential citations
        were identified, of which 21 studies (23 entries) were included. Most studies
        were conducted in Kenya (n=5) and Uganda (n=5) and judged to provide moderate
        (n=15) to low quality (n=7) evidence, with data not disaggregated by age.
        Seven studies reported on provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC),
        with the remainder reporting on family-centred (n=5), home-based (n=5), outreach
        (n=5) and school-linked HTC among primary schoolchildren (n=1). PITC among
        inpatients had the highest acceptability (86.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
        65.5 to 100%), yield (12.2%; 95% CI: 6.1 to 18.3%) and prevalence (15.4%;
        95% CI: 5.0 to 25.7%). Family-centred HTC had lower acceptance compared to
        home-based HTC (51.7%; 95% CI: 10.4 to 92.9% vs. 84.9%; 95% CI: 74.4 to 95.4%)
        yet higher prevalence (8.4%; 95% CI: 3.4 to 13.5% vs. 3.0%; 95% CI: 1.0 to
        4.9%). School-linked HTC showed poor acceptance and low prevalence. \n\n While
        PITC may have high test acceptability priority should be given to evaluating
        strategies beyond healthcare settings (e.g. home-based HTC among families)
        to identify individuals earlier in their disease progression. Data on linkage
        to care and cost-effectiveness of HTC strategies are needed to strengthen
        policies. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>BioMed Central</dc:publisher>\n

        manifestation of infection with Plasmodium falciparum. The pathology of cerebral
        malaria is characterized by the accumulation of infected erythrocytes (IEs)
        in the microvasculature of the brain caused by parasite adhesins on the surface
        of IEs binding to human receptors on microvascular endothelial cells. The
        parasite and host molecules involved in this interaction are unknown. We selected
        three P. falciparum strains (HB3, 3D7, and IT/FCR3) for binding to a human
        brain endothelial cell line (HBEC-5i). The whole transcriptome of isogenic
        pairs of selected and unselected parasites was analyzed using a variant surface
        antigen-supplemented microarray chip. After selection, the most highly and
        consistently up-regulated genes were a subset of group A-like var genes (HB3var3,
        3D7_PFD0020c, ITvar7, and ITvar19) that showed 11- to &gt;100-fold increased
        transcription levels. These var genes encode P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane
        protein (PfEMP)1 variants with distinct N-terminal domain types (domain cassette
        8 or domain cassette 13). Antibodies to HB3var3 and PFD0020c recognized the
        surface of live IEs and blocked binding to HBEC-5i, thereby confirming the
        adhesive function of these variants. The clinical in vivo relevance of the
        HBEC-selected parasites was supported by significantly higher surface recognition
        of HBEC-selected parasites compared with unselected parasites by antibodies
        from young African children suffering cerebral malaria (Mann-Whitney test,
        P = 0.029) but not by antibodies from controls with uncomplicated malaria
        (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.58). This work describes a binding phenotype for
        virulence-associated group A P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1
        variants and identifies targets for interventions to treat or prevent cerebral
        malaria. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>National Academy of

        Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are a global challenge. China, once
        said to have eradicated STIs, is now facing a rapid rise in the prevalence
        of HIV/STIs. This review of reviews aims to map HIV/STI risk factors among
        the Chinese population, with the objective of identifying risk factors to
        inform the formulation of effective prevention strategies. \n\n A systematic
        search using key terms related to HIV/STIs, risk factors and the Chinese population
        in both English and Chinese databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library;
        Wanfang data, CNKI, VIP and SINOMED) was conducted, and peer-reviewed systematic
        reviews on the topic from 1991 to 2014 were selected. Identified risk factors
        were grouped into different level determinants based on the HIV Social Epidemiology
        Model, and then evaluated and reported based on the PRISMA checklist. \n\n
        Of the twenty-eight reviews included, the majority were focused on well-established,
        individual level risk factors within key populations, with some highlighting
        the complexity of interacting factors (e.g., alcohol use and higher income
        in male migrants). While twenty-two reviews covered individual factors, only
        ten mentioned social factors and five had contents on structural factors.
        There are gaps in the evidence on social and structural level impacts of HIV/STIs,
        such as on stigma, discrimination, health policy, access to care, and illicit
        drug control policies. Migration and social expectation appear to pose a significant
        threat in aggravating the HIV/STI situation in China; for example, incarceration
        patterns indicated a significant risk of HIV/STIs for female sex workers.
        \n\n Since international guidelines recommend an integrated and multi-level
        approach to HIV/STI prevention, a comprehensive approach targeting interventions
        at all levels along the continuum of care is needed to effectively curtail
        HIV/STI transmission in China. More research is needed to better understand
        the impact of socio-political interventions within a Chinese context. \n\n</dc:description>\n

        Most human malaria deaths are caused by blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum
        parasites. Cerebral malaria, the most life-threatening complication of the
        disease, is characterised by an accumulation of Plasmodium falciparum infected
        red blood cells (iRBC) at pigmented trophozoite stage in the microvasculature
        of the brain(2-4). This microvessel obstruction (sequestration) leads to acidosis,
        hypoxia and harmful inflammatory cytokines (reviewed in (5)). Sequestration
        is also found in most microvascular tissues of the human body(2, 3). The mechanism
        by which iRBC attach to the blood vessel walls is still poorly understood.
        The immortalized Human Brain microvascular Endothelial Cell line (HBEC-5i)
        has been used as an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier(6). However,
        Plasmodium falciparum iRBC attach only poorly to HBEC-5i in vitro, unlike
        the dense sequestration that occurs in cerebral malaria cases. We therefore
        developed a panning assay to select (enrich) various P. falciparum strains
        for adhesion to HBEC-5i in order to obtain populations of high-binding parasites,
        more representative of what occurs in vivo. A sample of a parasite culture
        (mixture of iRBC and uninfected RBC) at the pigmented trophozoite stage is
        washed and incubated on a layer of HBEC-5i grown on a Petri dish. After incubation,
        the dish is gently washed free from uRBC and unbound iRBC. Fresh uRBC are
        added to the few iRBC attached to HBEC-5i and incubated overnight. As schizont
        stage parasites burst, merozoites reinvade RBC and these ring stage parasites
        are harvested the following day. Parasites are cultured until enough material
        is obtained (typically 2 to 4 weeks) and a new round of selection can be performed.
        Depending on the P. falciparum strain, 4 to 7 rounds of selection are needed
        in order to get a population where most parasites bind to HBEC-5i. The binding
        phenotype is progressively lost after a few weeks, indicating a switch in
        variant surface antigen gene expression, thus regular selection on HBEC-5i
        is required to maintain the phenotype. In summary, we developed a selection
        assay rendering P. falciparum parasites a more \"cerebral malaria adhesive\"
        phenotype. We were able to select 3 out of 4 P. falciparum strains on HBEC-5i.
        This assay has also successfully been used to select parasites for binding
        to human dermal and pulmonary endothelial cells. Importantly, this method
        can be used to select tissue-specific parasite populations in order to identify
        candidate parasite ligands for binding to brain endothelium. Moreover, this
        assay can be used to screen for putative anti-sequestration drugs(7). \n\n</dc:description>\n

        Frail and dependent older people in resource-poor settings are poorly served
        by health systems that lack outreach capacity. The COPE (Caring for Older
        PEople) multidimensional assessment tool is designed to help community health
        workers (CHWs) identify clinically significant impairments and deliver evidence-based
        interventions \n\n Older people (n\u2009=\u2009150) identified by CHWs as
        frail or dependent, were assessed at home by the CHW using the structured
        COPE assessment tool, generating information on impairments in nutrition,
        mobility, vision, hearing, continence, cognition, mood and behaviour. The
        older people were reassessed by local physicians who reached a clinical judgment
        regarding the presence or absence of the same impairments based upon clinical
        examination guided by the EASY-Care assessment tool. \n\n The COPE tool was
        considered easy to administer, and gave CHWs a sense of empowerment to understand
        and act upon the needs of older people. Agreement between COPE assessment
        by CHW and clinician assessors was modest (ranged from 45.8 to 91.3\_%) for
        most impairments. However, the prevalence of impairments was generally higher
        according to clinicians, particularly for visual impairment (98.7 vs 45.8\_%),
        cognitive impairment (78.4 vs. 38.2\_%) and depression (82.0 vs. 59.9\_%).
        Most cases identified by WHO-COPE were clinician confirmed (positive predictive
        values - 72.2 to 98.5\_%), and levels of disability and needs for care among
        those identified by COPE were higher than those additionally identified by
        the clinician alone. \n\n The COPE is a feasible tool for the identification
        of specific impairments in frail dependent older people in the community.
        Those identified are likely to be confirmed as having clinically relevant
        problems by clinicians working in the same service, and the COPE may be particularly
        effective at targeting attention upon those with the most substantial unmet
        needs. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>BioMed Central</dc:publisher>\n

        To compare the cancer risk of cladribine and other disease-modifying drugs
        (DMDs) in trials of people with relapsing multiple sclerosis (pwRMS). \n\n
        Meta-analysis of phase III trials of licensed DMDs for pwRMS and a phase III
        trial of cladribine (CLARITY). Cancer rates were compared using Fisher exact
        test. \n\n Eleven trials were included. Investigated treatments included cladribine,
        dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, teriflunomide, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, and
        glatiramer acetate. The cancer rate in the CLARITY treatment group (0.34%)
        was not increased compared to all other treatment groups, whether including
        placebo-controlled trials only (0.6%, p = 0.4631) or all trials, i.e., including
        those with an active comparator arm (0.67%, p = 0.3669). No cancer was reported
        in the CLARITY placebo group, whereas the combined cancer rate of all other
        placebo groups was 1.19% (p = 0.0159). The cancer rate of zero in the CLARITY
        placebo group was also lower than that in the phase III trial of cladribine
        in people with clinically isolated syndrome (ORACLE MS, 2.91%, p = 0.0012).
        In fact, no difference was detected between cancer rates in the treatment
        groups of CLARITY (0.34%) and ORACLE MS (0.49%) (p = 0.6546). \n\n Our study
        does not support an increased cancer risk from cladribine in the doses used
        in CLARITY and ORACLE MS, which previously contributed to refusal of market
        authorization of cladribine in Europe. Longer-term follow-up is required to
        assess the safety profile of cladribine, as well as currently licensed DMDs,
        to definitively assess cancer risk. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Wolters

        P. vivax is an important public health burden in Ethiopia, accounting for
        almost half of all malaria cases. Owing to heterogeneous transmission across
        the country, a stronger evidence base on local transmission dynamics is needed
        to optimise allocation of resources and improve malaria interventions. \n\n
        In a pilot evaluation of local level P. vivax molecular surveillance in southern
        Ethiopia, the diversity and population structure of isolates collected between
        May and November 2013 were investigated. Blood samples were collected from
        microscopy positive P. vivax patients recruited to clinical and cross-sectional
        surveys from four sites: Arbaminch, Halaba, Badawacho and Hawassa. Parasite
        genotyping was undertaken at nine tandem repeat markers. Eight loci were successfully
        genotyped in 197 samples (between 36 and 59 per site). Heterogeneity was observed
        in parasite diversity and structure amongst the sites. Badawacho displayed
        evidence of unstable transmission, with clusters of identical clonal infections.
        Linkage disequilibrium in Badawacho was higher (IAS = 0.32, P = 0.010) than
        in the other populations (IAS range = 0.01-0.02) and declined markedly after
        adjusting for identical infections (IAS = 0.06, P = 0.010). Other than Badawacho
        (HE = 0.70), population diversity was equivalently high across the sites (HE
        = 0.83). Polyclonal infections were more frequent in Hawassa (67%) than the
        other populations (range: 8-44%). Despite the variable diversity, differentiation
        between the sites was low (FST range: 5 x 10-3-0.03). \n\n Marked variation
        in parasite population structure likely reflects differing local transmission
        dynamics. Parasite genotyping in these heterogeneous settings has potential
        to provide important complementary information with which to optimise malaria
        control interventions. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Public

        the cost-effectiveness of extending the pre-2013 influenza immunisation programme
        for high-risk and elderly individuals to those at low risk of developing complications
        following infection with seasonal influenza. \n\n We performed an economic
        evaluation comparing different extensions of the pre-2013 influenza programme
        to seven possible age groups of low-risk individuals (aged 2-4 years, 50-64
        years, 5-16 years, 2-4 and 50-64 years, 2-16 years, 2-16 and 50-64 years,
        and 2-64 years). These extensions are evaluated incrementally on four base
        scenarios (no vaccination, risk group only with coverage as observed between
        1995 and 2009, risk group and 65+, and risk group with 75 % coverage and 65+).
        Impact of vaccination is assessed using a transmission model built and parameterised
        from a previously published study. The study population is all individuals
        of all ages in England and Wales representing an average total of 52.6 million
        people over 14 influenza seasons (1995-2009). \n\n The influenza programme
        (risk group and elderly) prior to 2013 is likely to be cost effective (incremental
        cost effectiveness ratio: 7,475 \xA3/QALY, net benefit: 253 M\xA3 [15-829]).
        Extension to any one of the low-risk target groups defined earlier is likely
        to be cost-effective. However, strategies that do not include vaccination
        of school-aged children are less likely to be cost-effective. The most efficient
        strategy is extension to the 5-16 year age group while universal vaccination
        (extension to all low-risk individuals over 2 years) will achieve the highest
        net benefit. While extension to the 2-16 year age group is likely to be very
        cost effective, the cost-effectiveness of extensions beyond 2-16 years is
        very uncertain. Extension to the 5-16 year age group would likely remain cost-effective
        even without herd immunity effects to other age groups. As our study includes
        a strong historical component, our results depend on the efficacy of the influenza
        vaccine remaining at levels similar to the ones achieved in the past over
        a long-period of time (assumed to vary between 28 % and 70 % depending of
        the circulating strains and age groups). \n\n Making use of surveillance data
        from over a decade in conjunction with a dynamic model, we find that vaccination
        of children in the United Kingdom is likely to be highly cost-effective, not
        only for their own benefit but also to reduce the disease burden in the rest
        of the community. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>BioMed Central</dc:publisher>\n

        JA</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description> The cytoadherence of Plasmodium
        falciparum is thought to be mediated by variant surface antigens (VSA), encoded
        by var, rif, stevor and pfmc-2tm genes. The last three families have rarely
        been studied in the context of cytoadherence. As most VSA genes are unique,
        the variability among sequences has impeded the functional study of VSA across
        different P. falciparum strains. However, many P. falciparum genomes have
        recently been sequenced, allowing the development of specific microarray probes
        for each VSA gene. \n\n All VSA sequences from the HB3, Dd2 and IT/FCR3 genomes
        were extracted using HMMer software. Oligonucleotide probes were designed
        with OligoRankPick and added to the 3D7-based microarray chip. As a proof
        of concept, IT/R29 parasites were selected for and against rosette formation
        and the transcriptomes of isogenic rosetting and non-rosetting parasites were
        compared by microarray. \n\n From each parasite strain 50-56 var genes, 125-132
        rif genes, 26-33 stevor genes and 3-8 pfmc-2tm genes were identified. Bioinformatic
        analysis of the new VSA sequences showed that 13 rif genes and five stevor
        genes were well-conserved across at least three strains (83-100% amino acid
        identity). The ability of the VSA-supplemented microarray chip to detect cytoadherence-related
        genes was assessed using P. falciparum clone IT/R29, in which rosetting is
        known to be mediated by PfEMP1 encoded by ITvar9. Whole transcriptome analysis
        showed that the most highly up-regulated gene in rosetting parasites was ITvar9
        (19 to 429-fold up-regulated over six time points). Only one rif gene (IT4rifA_042)
        was up-regulated by more than four fold (five fold at 12 hours post-invasion),
        and no stevor or pfmc-2tm genes were up-regulated by more than two fold. 377
        non-VSA genes were differentially expressed by three fold or more in rosetting
        parasites, although none was as markedly or consistently up-regulated as ITvar9.
        \n\n Probes for the VSA of newly sequenced P. falciparum strains can be added
        to the 3D7-based microarray chip, allowing the analysis of the entire transcriptome
        of multiple strains. For the rosetting clone IT/R29, the striking transcriptional
        upregulation of ITvar9 was confirmed, and the data did not support the involvement
        of other VSA families in rosette formation. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>BioMed

        Randomized clinical trials that enroll patients in critical or emergency care
        (acute care) setting are challenging because of narrow time windows for recruitment
        and the inability of many patients to provide informed consent. To assess
        the extent that recruitment challenges lead to randomized clinical trial discontinuation,
        we compared the discontinuation of acute care and nonacute care randomized
        clinical trials. \n\n Retrospective cohort of 894 randomized clinical trials
        approved by six institutional review boards in Switzerland, Germany, and Canada
        between 2000 and 2003. \n\n Randomized clinical trials involving patients
        in an acute or nonacute care setting. \n\n We recorded trial characteristics,
        self-reported trial discontinuation, and self-reported reasons for discontinuation
        from protocols, corresponding publications, institutional review board files,
        and a survey of investigators. \n\n Of 894 randomized clinical trials, 64
        (7%) were acute care randomized clinical trials (29 critical care and 35 emergency
        care). Compared with the 830 nonacute care randomized clinical trials, acute
        care randomized clinical trials were more frequently discontinued (28 of 64,
        44% vs 221 of 830, 27%; p = 0.004). Slow recruitment was the most frequent
        reason for discontinuation, both in acute care (13 of 64, 20%) and in nonacute
        care randomized clinical trials (7 of 64, 11%). Logistic regression analyses
        suggested the acute care setting as an independent risk factor for randomized
        clinical trial discontinuation specifically as a result of slow recruitment
        (odds ratio, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.72-9.31) after adjusting for other established
        risk factors, including nonindustry sponsorship and small sample size. \n\n
        Acute care randomized clinical trials are more vulnerable to premature discontinuation
        than nonacute care randomized clinical trials and have an approximately four-fold
        higher risk of discontinuation due to slow recruitment. These results highlight
        the need for strategies to reliably prevent and resolve slow patient recruitment
        in randomized clinical trials conducted in the critical and emergency care
        setting. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Lippincott, Williams

        D</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description> The most polymorphic gene family
        in P. falciparum is the \u223C60 var genes distributed across parasite chromosomes,
        both in the subtelomeres and in internal regions. They encode hypervariable
        surface proteins known as P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1)
        that are critical for pathogenesis and immune evasion in Plasmodium falciparum.
        How var gene sequence diversity is generated is not currently completely understood.
        To address this, we constructed large clone trees and performed whole genome
        sequence analysis to study the generation of novel var gene sequences in asexually
        replicating parasites. While single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were scattered
        across the genome, structural variants (deletions, duplications, translocations)
        were focused in and around var genes, with considerable variation in frequency
        between strains. Analysis of more than 100 recombination events involving
        var exon 1 revealed that the average nucleotide sequence identity of two recombining
        exons was only 63% (range: 52.7-72.4%) yet the crossovers were error-free
        and occurred in such a way that the resulting sequence was in frame and domain
        architecture was preserved. Var exon 1, which encodes the immunologically
        exposed part of the protein, recombined in up to 0.2% of infected erythrocytes
        in vitro per life cycle. The high rate of var exon 1 recombination indicates
        that millions of new antigenic structures could potentially be generated each
        day in a single infected individual. We propose a model whereby var gene sequence
        polymorphism is mainly generated during the asexual part of the life cycle.

        warning labels are the subject of a voluntary agreement between industry and
        government. In 2011, as part of the Public Health Responsibility Deal in England,
        the industry pledged to ensure that 80% of products would have clear, legible
        health warning labelling, although an analysis commissioned by Portman found
        that only 57.1% met best practice. We assessed what proportion of alcohol
        products now contain the required health warning information, and its clarity
        and placement.&lt;br/&gt; DESIGN: Survey of alcohol labelling data.&lt;br/&gt;
        SETTING: United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt; PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of the United Kingdom's
        100 top-selling alcohol brands (n\u2009=\u2009156 individual products).&lt;br/&gt;
        MEASUREMENTS: We assessed the product labels in relation to the presence of
        five labelling elements: information on alcohol units, government consumption
        guidelines, pregnancy warnings, reference to the Drinkaware website and a
        responsibility statement. We also assessed the size, colour and placement
        of text, and the size and colouring of the pregnancy warning logo.&lt;br/&gt;
        FINDINGS: The first three (required) elements were present on 77.6% of products
        examined. The mean font size of the Chief Medical Officer's (CMO) unit guidelines
        (usually on the back of the product) was 8.17-point. The mean size of pregnancy
        logos was 5.95\u2009mm. The pregnancy logo was on average smaller on wine
        containers.&lt;br/&gt; CONCLUSIONS: The UK Public Health Responsibility Deal
        alcohol labelling pledge has not been fully met. Labelling information frequently
        falls short of best practice, with font and logos smaller than would be accepted
        on other products with health effects.&lt;br/&gt; </dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Wiley</dc:publisher>\n

        are capable of folding into an intramolecular four-stranded structure called
        a G-quadruplex. When found in gene promoter regions, G-quadruplexes can downregulate
        gene expression, possibly by blocking the transcriptional machinery. Here
        we have used a genome-wide bioinformatic approach to identify Putative G-Quadruplex
        Sequences (PQS) in the Plasmodium falciparum genome, along with biophysical
        techniques to examine the physiological stability of P. falciparum PQS in
        vitro. \n\n We identified 63 PQS in the non-telomeric regions of the P. falciparum
        clone 3D7. Interestingly, 16 of these PQS occurred in the upstream region
        of a subset of the P. falciparum var genes (group B var genes). The var gene
        family encodes PfEMP1, the parasite's major variant antigen and adhesin expressed
        at the surface of infected erythrocytes, that plays a key role in malaria
        pathogenesis and immune evasion. The ability of the PQS found in the upstream
        regions of group B var genes (UpsB-Q) to form stable G-quadruplex structures
        in vitro was confirmed using 1H NMR, circular dichroism, UV spectroscopy,
        and thermal denaturation experiments. Moreover, the synthetic compound BOQ1
        that shows a higher affinity for DNA forming quadruplex rather than duplex
        structures was found to bind with high affinity to the UpsB-Q. \n\n This is
        the first demonstration of non-telomeric PQS in the genome of P. falciparum
        that form stable G-quadruplexes under physiological conditions in vitro. These
        results allow the generation of a novel hypothesis that the G-quadruplex sequences
        in the upstream regions of var genes have the potential to play a role in
        the transcriptional control of this major virulence-associated multi-gene
        family. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>BioMed Central</dc:publisher>\n

        introduction of smoke-free legislation in the UK (March 2006 for Scotland,
        April 2007 for Wales and Northern Ireland, and July 2007 for England) and
        the incidence of respiratory diseases among children. We extracted monthly
        counts of new diagnoses of wheezing/asthma and RTIs among children aged 0-12
        years from all general practices in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink
        during 1997-2012. Interrupted time series analyses were performed using generalised
        additive mixed models, adjusting for underlying incidence trends, population
        size changes, seasonal factors, and pandemic influenza, as appropriate. 366,642
        new wheezing/asthma diagnoses and 4,324,789 RTIs were observed over 9,536,003
        patient-years. There was no statistically significant change in the incidence
        of wheezing/asthma after introduction of smoke-free legislation in England
        (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.81-1.09) or any other UK country
        (Scotland: IRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83-1.19; Wales: IRR 1.09, 95% CI 0.89-1.35;
        Northern Ireland: IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.76-1.22). Similarly no statistically
        significant changes in RTI incidence were demonstrated (England: IRR 0.95,
        95% CI 0.86-1.06; Scotland: IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83-1.11; Wales: IRR 0.97, 95%
        CI 0.86-1.09; Northern Ireland: IRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79-1.03). There were no
        demonstrable reductions in the incidence of paediatric wheezing/asthma or
        RTIs following introduction of smoke-free legislation in the UK. \n\n</dc:description>\n

        was conducted to assess the prevalence of latent TB Infection (LTBI) and to
        estimate the annual risk of M. tuberculosis infection (ARTI) in Gambian school
        children. The results are expected to contribute to understanding of Tuberculosis
        epidemiology in The Gambia. \n\n This was a nationwide, multi-cluster survey
        in children aged 6-11 years. Districts, 20 of 37, were selected by probability
        proportional to size and schools by simple random sampling. All TST were performed
        using the Mantoux method. Height and weight measurements were obtained for
        all participants. We calculated prevalence of LTBI using cut-off points of
        10mm, the mirror and mixture modelling methods. \n\n TST readings were completed
        13,386 children with median age of 9 years (interquartile range [IQR] 8-10
        years). Mixture analysis yielded a cut-off point of 12 mm, and LTBI prevalence
        of 6.9% [95%CI 6.47-7.37] and the ARTI was 0.75% [95%CI 0.60-0.91]. LTBI was
        associated gender and urban residence (p &lt;0.01). Nutritional status was
        not associated with non-reactive TST or sizes of TST indurations. ARTI did
        not differ significantly by age, gender, BCG vaccination or residence. \n\n
        This estimates for LTBI prevalence and ARTI were low but this survey provides
        updated data. Malnutrition did not affect estimates of LTBI and ARTI. Given
        the low ARTI in this survey and the overlapping distribution of indurations
        with mixture modelling, further surveys may require complementary tests such
        as interferon gamma release assays or novel diagnostic tools. \n\n</dc:description>\n

        of social interventions are often criticised as failing to open the 'black
        box' whereby they only address questions about 'what works' without explaining
        the underlying processes of implementation and mechanisms of action, and how
        these vary by contextual characteristics of person and place. Realist RCTs
        are proposed as an approach to evaluation science that addresses these gaps
        while preserving the strengths of RCTs in providing evidence with strong internal
        validity in estimating effects. \n\n In the context of growing interest in
        designing and conducting realist trials, there is an urgent need to offer
        a worked example to provide guidance on how such an approach might be practically
        taken forward. The aim of this paper is to outline a three-staged theoretical
        and methodological process of undertaking a realist RCT using the example
        of the evaluation of a whole-school restorative intervention aiming to reduce
        aggression and bullying in English secondary schools. \n\n First, informed
        by the findings of our initial pilot trial and sociological theory, we elaborate
        our theory of change and specific a priori hypotheses about how intervention
        mechanisms interact with context to produce outcomes. Second, we describe
        how we will use emerging findings from the integral process evaluation within
        the RCT to refine, and add to, these a priori hypotheses before the collection
        of quantitative, follow-up data. Third, we will test our hypotheses using
        a combination of process and outcome data via quantitative analyses of effect
        mediation (examining mechanisms) and moderation (examining contextual contingencies).
        The results are then used to refine and further develop the theory of change.
        \n\n The aim of the realist RCT approach is thus not merely to assess whether
        the intervention is effective or not, but to develop empirically informed
        mid-range theory through a three-stage process. There are important implications
        for those involved with reporting and reviewing RCTs, including the use of
        new, iterative protocols. \n\n Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN10751359 (Registered

        A growing proportion of the global population rely on shared sanitation facilities,
        despite their association with adverse health outcomes. We sought to explore
        differences between neighbour-shared and communal latrines in terms household
        demographics, accessibility, facilities and use. \n\n We conducted surveys
        among 295 households relying on shared sanitation in 30 slums in Orissa, India,
        60.3% (178) of which relied on neighbour-shared latrines while the balance
        relied on communal latrines. We collected household demographic data, conducted
        latrine spot-checks and collected data on indicators of use, accessibility,
        privacy and cleanliness. \n\n Compared to neighbour-shared facilities, households
        relying on communal facilities were poorer, larger, less educated, less likely
        to have access to piped water and more likely to have a member practicing
        open defecation. Communal latrines were also less accessible, less likely
        to have water or a hand washing station on site and cleaned less frequently;
        they were more likely to have visible faeces and flies present. \n\n We found
        significant differences between neighbour-shared and communal facilities in
        terms of user demographics, access, facilities and cleanliness that could
        potentially explain differences in health. These findings highlight the need
        for a shared sanitation policy that focuses not just on the number of users,
        but also on maintenance, accessibility, cleanliness and provision of water
        and hand washing facilities. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Oxford

        FREE Investigators</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description> Background Patients
        at high risk for bleeding who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
        often receive bare-metal stents followed by 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy.
        We studied a polymer-free and carrier-free drug-coated stent that transfers
        umirolimus (also known as biolimus A9), a highly lipophilic sirolimus analogue,
        into the vessel wall over a period of 1 month. Methods In a randomized, double-blind
        trial, we compared the drug-coated stent with a very similar bare-metal stent
        in patients with a high risk of bleeding who underwent PCI. All patients received
        1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary safety end point, tested
        for both noninferiority and superiority, was a composite of cardiac death,
        myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis. The primary efficacy end point
        was clinically driven target-lesion revascularization. Results We enrolled
        2466 patients. At 390 days, the primary safety end point had occurred in 112
        patients (9.4%) in the drug-coated-stent group and in 154 patients (12.9%)
        in the bare-metal-stent group (risk difference, -3.6 percentage points; 95%
        confidence interval [CI], -6.1 to -1.0; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56 to
        0.91; P&lt;0.001 for noninferiority and P=0.005 for superiority). During the
        same time period, clinically driven target-lesion revascularization was needed
        in 59 patients (5.1%) in the drug-coated-stent group and in 113 patients (9.8%)
        in the bare-metal-stent group (risk difference, -4.8 percentage points; 95%
        CI, -6.9 to -2.6; hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.69; P&lt;0.001). Conclusions
        Among patients at high risk for bleeding who underwent PCI, a polymer-free
        umirolimus-coated stent was superior to a bare-metal stent with respect to
        the primary safety and efficacy end points when used with a 1-month course
        of dual antiplatelet therapy. (Funded by Biosensors Europe; LEADERS FREE ClinicalTrials.gov

        Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is standard treatment for symptomatic carotid
        artery stenosis but carries a risk of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI),
        or death. This study investigated risk factors for these procedural complications
        occurring within 30 days of endarterectomy in the International Carotid Stenting
        Study (ICSS). \n\n Patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis &gt;50%
        were randomly allocated to endarterectomy or stenting. Analysis is reported
        of patients in ICSS assigned to endarterectomy and limited to those in whom
        CEA was initiated. The occurrence of stroke, MI, or death within 30 days of
        the procedure was reported by investigators and adjudicated. Demographic and
        technical risk factors for these complications were analysed sequentially
        in a binomial regression analysis and subsequently in a multivariable model.
        \n\n Eight-hundred and twenty-one patients were included in the analysis.
        The risk of stroke, MI, or death within 30 days of CEA was 4.0%. The risk
        was higher in female patients (risk ratio [RR] 1.98, 95% CI 1.02-3.87, p\_=\_.05)
        and with increasing baseline diastolic blood pressure (dBP) (RR 1.30 per\_+10\_mmHg,
        95% CI 1.02-1.66, p\_=\_.04). Mean baseline dBP, obtained at the time of randomization
        in the trial, was 78\_mmHg (SD 13\_mmHg). In a multivariable model, only dBP
        remained a significant predictor. The risk was not related to the type of
        surgical reconstruction, anaesthetic technique, or perioperative medication
        regimen. Patients undergoing CEA stayed a median of 4 days before discharge,
        and 21.2% of events occurred on or after the day of discharge. \n\n Increasing
        diastolic blood pressure was the only independent risk factor for stroke,
        MI, or death following CEA. Cautious attention to blood pressure control following
        symptoms attributable to carotid stenosis could reduce the risks associated
        with subsequent CEA. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher>\n

        rate (15-20%) despite treatment with effective antimalarial drugs. Adjunctive
        therapies for severe malaria that target the underlying disease process are
        therefore urgently required. Adhesion of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium
        falciparum to human cells has a key role in the pathogenesis of life-threatening
        malaria and could be targeted with antiadhesion therapy. Parasite adhesion
        interactions include binding to endothelial cells (cytoadherence), rosetting
        with uninfected erythrocytes and platelet-mediated clumping of infected erythrocytes.
        Recent research has started to define the molecular mechanisms of parasite
        adhesion, and antiadhesion therapies are being explored. However, many fundamental
        questions regarding the role of parasite adhesion in severe malaria remain
        unanswered. There is strong evidence that rosetting contributes to severe
        malaria in sub-Saharan Africa; however, the identity of other parasite adhesion
        phenotypes that are implicated in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. In
        addition, the possibility of geographic variation in adhesion phenotypes causing
        severe malaria, linked to differences in malaria transmission levels and host
        immunity, has been neglected. Further research is needed to realise the untapped
        potential of antiadhesion adjunctive therapies, which could revolutionize
        the treatment of severe malaria and reduce the high mortality rate of the
        disease. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Cambridge University

        for health research of Canada Post's transition from door-to-door postal delivery

        Positional errors involve misplacing people's residential location. Linkage
        errors result from incorrectly linking residential location from community
        mailboxes to census or health administrative data. The article discusses examples
        of how the transition to community mailboxes could have important implications

        Despite a declining prevalence in many countries, smoking rates remain consistently
        high among young adults. Targeting contextual influences on smoking, such
        as the availability of tobacco retailers, is one promising avenue of intervention.
        Most studies have focused on residential or school neighbourhoods, without
        accounting for other settings where individuals spend time, that is, their
        activity space. We investigated the association between tobacco retailer availability
        in the residential neighbourhood and in the activity space, and smoking status.
        \n\n Cross-sectional baseline data from 1994 young adults (aged 18-25) participating
        in the Interdisciplinary Study of Inequalities in Smoking (Montreal, Canada,
        2011-2012) were analysed. Residential and activity locations served to derive
        two measures of tobacco retailer availability: counts within 500\u2005m buffers
        and proximity to the nearest retailer. Prevalence ratios for the association
        between each tobacco retailer measure and smoking status were estimated using
        log-binomial regression. \n\n Participants encountering high numbers of tobacco
        retailers in their residential neighbourhood, and both medium and high retailer
        counts in their activity space, were more likely to smoke compared to those
        exposed to fewer retailers. While residential proximity was not associated
        with smoking, we found 36% and 42% higher smoking prevalence among participants
        conducting activities within medium and high proximity to tobacco retailers
        compared to those conducting activities further from such outlets. \n\n This
        study adds to the sparse literature on contextual correlates of smoking among
        young adults, and illustrates the added value of considering individuals'
        activity space in contextual studies of smoking. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>BMJ

        \       <dc:creator>Ellaway, A</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description> Smoking
        is a major public health problem worldwide. Research has shown that neighbourhood
        of residence is independently associated with the likelihood of individuals'
        smoking. However, a fine comprehension of which neighbourhood characteristics
        are involved and how remains limited. In this study we examine the relative
        contribution of objective (police-recorded) and subjective (resident-perceived)
        measures of neighbourhood crime on residents' smoking behaviours. \n\n Data
        from 2,418 men and women participating in the 2007/8 sweep of the West of
        Scotland Twenty-07 Study were analyzed. Smoking status and perceived crime
        were collected through face-to-face interviews with participants. Police-recorded
        crime rates were obtained from the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics website
        at the datazone scale. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were
        estimated for the likelihood of current smoking using logistic regression
        models. Adjusted mean daily amount smoked and F statistics were calculated
        using general linear models. Analyses were conducted for all respondents and
        stratified by sex and age cohort. \n\n Compared to individuals living in low
        crime areas, those residing in an area characterized by high police-recorded
        crime rates or those perceiving high crime in their neighbourhood were more
        likely to be current smokers, after controlling for individual characteristics.
        The association with smoking was somewhat stronger for police-recorded crime
        than for perceived crime. Associations were only slightly attenuated when
        adjusting for either the objective or subjective crime measures, suggesting
        that these indicators may exert an independent influence on the risk of smoking.
        Stronger effects were observed for women compared to men. Police-recorded
        crime rates were more strongly related to smoking status among older respondents
        than among the younger cohort, whereas the strongest effect for perceived
        crime was observed among younger participants. \n\n Our findings highlight
        the relevance of paying attention to both objective and perceived neighbourhood
        crime measures when aiming to prevent smoking. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>BioMed

        for health is a basic action principle of health promotion, and equity is
        a core value. A settings approach offers an opportunity to bridge these two,
        with its focus on the interplay between individual, environmental and social
        determinants of health. \n\n We conducted a scoping review of the literature
        on theoretical bases and practical applications of the settings approach.
        Interventions targeting social inequities in health through action on various
        settings were analyzed to establish what is done in health equity research
        and action as it relates to settings. \n\n Four elements emerged as central
        to an equity-focused settings approach: a focus on social determinants of
        health, addressing the needs of marginalized groups, effecting change in a
        setting's structure, and involving stakeholders. Each came with related challenges.
        To offer potential solutions to these challenges we developed a conceptual
        framework that integrates theoretical and methodological approaches, along
        with six core guiding principles, into a 'settings praxis'. \n\n Reducing
        social inequities in health through the creation of supportive environments
        requires the application of the settings approach in an innovative way. The
        proposed conceptual framework can serve as a guide to do so, and help develop,
        implement and evaluate equity-focused settings-related interventions. \n\n</dc:description>\n

        L</dc:creator>\n        <dc:description> Female sex workers (FSWs) frequently
        experience violence, harassment and arrest by the police or their clients,
        but there is little evidence as to the impact that such factors may have on
        HIV risk or whether community interventions could mitigate this impact. \n\n
        As part of the evaluation of the Avahan programme in Karnataka, serial integrated
        behavioural and biological assessment (IBBA) surveys (four districts) (2005
        to 2011) and anonymous polling booth surveys (PBS) (16 districts) (2007 to
        2011) were conducted with random samples of FSWs. Logistic regression analysis
        was used to assess 1) changes in reported violence and arrests over time and
        2) associations between violence by non-partners and police arrest and HIV/STI
        risk and prevalence. Mediation analysis was used to identify mediating factors.
        \n\n 5,792 FSWs participated in the IBBAs and 15,813 participated in the PBS.
        Over time, there were significant reductions in the percentages of FSWs reporting
        being raped in the past year (PBS) (30.0% in 2007, 10.0% in 2011, p&amp;lt;0.001),
        being arrested in the past year [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.57 (0.35, 0.93),
        p=0.025] and being beaten in the past six months by a non-partner (clients,
        police, pimps, strangers, rowdies) [AOR 0.69 (0.49, 0.95), p=0.024)] (IBBA).
        The proportion drinking alcohol (during the past week) also fell significantly
        (32.5% in 2005, 24.9% in 2008, 16.8% in 2011; p&amp;lt;0.001). Violence by
        non-partners (being raped in the past year and/or beaten in the past six months)
        and being arrested in the past year were both strongly associated with HIV
        infection [AOR 1.59 (1.18, 2.15), p=0.002; AOR 1.91 (1.17, 3.12), p=0.01,
        respectively]. They were also associated with drinking alcohol (during the
        past week) [AOR 1.98 (1.54, 2.53), p&amp;lt;0.001; AOR 2.79 (1.93, 4.04),
        p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively], reduced condom self-efficacy with clients [AOR
        0.36 (0.27, 0.47), p&amp;lt;0.001; AOR 0.62 (0.39, 0.98), p=0.039, respectively],
        symptomatic STI (during the past year) [AOR 2.62 (2.07, 3.30), p&amp;lt;0.001;
        AOR 2.17 (1.51, 3.13), p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively], gonorrhoea infection
        [AOR 2.79 (1.51, 5.15), p=0.001; AOR 2.69 (0.96, 7.56), p=0.060, respectively]
        and syphilis infection [AOR 1.86 (1.04, 3.31), p=0.036; AOR 3.35 (1.78, 6.28),
        p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively], but not with exposure to peer education, community
        mobilization or HIV testing uptake. Mediation analysis suggests that alcohol
        use and STIs may partially mediate the association between violence or arrests
        and HIV prevalence. \n\n Violence by non-partners and arrest are both strongly
        associated with HIV infection among FSWs. Large-scale, comprehensive HIV prevention
        programming can reduce violence, arrests and HIV/STI infection among FSWs.

        The Interdisciplinary Study of Inequalities in Smoking (ISIS) is a cohort
        study investigating the joint effects of residents' socio-demographic characteristics
        and neighbourhood attributes on the social distribution of smoking in a young
        adult population. Smoking is a behaviour with an increasingly steep social
        class gradient; smoking prevalence among young adults is no longer declining
        at the same rate as among the rest of the population, and there is evidence
        of growing place-based disparities in smoking. ISIS was established to examine
        these pressing concerns. The ISIS sample comprises non-institutionalized individuals
        aged 18-25 years, who are proficient in English and/or French and who had
        been living at their current address in Montr\xE9al, Canada, for at least
        1 year at time of first contact. Two waves of data have been collected: baseline
        data were collected November 2011-September 2012 (n\u2009=\u20092093), and
        a second wave of data was collected January-June 2014 (n\u2009=\u20091457).
        Data were collected from respondents using a self-administered questionnaire,
        developed by the research team based on sociological theory, which includes
        questions concerning social, economic, cultural and biological capital, and
        activity space as well as smoking behaviour. Data are available upon request
        from [katherine.frohlich@umontreal.ca]. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Oxford

        paper explores which of absolute (i.e. densities of &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot;
        and &amp;quot;unhealthy&amp;quot; food outlets taken separately) or relative
        (i.e. the percentage of &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; outlets) measures of foodscape
        exposure better predicts fruit and vegetable intake (FVI), and whether those
        associations are modified by gender and city in Canada. \n\n Self-reported
        FVI from participants of four cycles (2007-2010) of the repeated cross-sectional
        Canadian Community Health Survey living in the five largest metropolitan areas
        of Canada (n=49,403) was analyzed. Absolute and relative measures of foodscape
        exposure were computed at participants' residential postal codes. Linear regression
        models, both in the whole sample and in gender- and city-stratified samples,
        were used to explore the associations between exposure measures and FVI. \n\n
        The percentage of healthy outlets was strongly associated with FVI among men
        both in Toronto/Montreal (\u03B2=0.012; P&amp;lt;0.001), and in Calgary/Ottawa/Vancouver
        (\u03B2=0.008; P&amp;lt;0.001), but not among women. Observed associations
        of absolute measures with FVI were either weak or faced multicollinearity
        issues. Overall, models with the relative measure showed the best fit. \n\n
        Relative measures should be more widely used when assessing foodscape influences
        on diet. The absence of a single effect of the foodscape on diet positions
        sub-group analysis as a promising avenue for research. \n\n</dc:description>\n

        Despite growing interest in integrating people\u05F3s daily mobility into
        contextual studies of social inequalities in health, the links between daily
        mobility and health inequalities remain inadequately conceptualised. This
        conceptual proposal anchors the relationship between daily mobility and contextual
        influences on social inequalities in health into the concept of mobility potential,
        which encompasses the opportunities and places individuals can choose (or
        are constrained) to access. Mobility potential is realized as actual mobility
        through agency. Being shaped by socially-patterned personal and geographic
        characteristics, mobility potential is unequally distributed across social
        groups. Social inequalities in realized mobility may thus result. We discuss
        pathways by which these may contribute to contextual influences on social
        inequalities in health. One pathway is reflected in disadvantaged groups encountering
        more fast-food outlets during their daily activities, which may relate to
        their higher risk of unhealthy eating. This proposal lays the bases for empirical
        research explicitly testing hypotheses regarding the contribution of daily
        mobility to social inequalities in health. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher>\n

        of \u2018natural experiments\u2019 in public policy are typically considered
        \u2018weak\u2019 evidence. Challenges include: making credible claims for
        causal inference (internal validity); generalizing beyond the case (external
        validity); and providing useful evidence for decision makers. In public health,
        where experimental evidence is encouraged by funders and enjoys a degree of
        rhetorical favour, in theory if not practice, current guidance for evaluating
        natural experiments focuses largely on methods for strengthening internal
        validity. Using a case study of the evaluation of free bus travel for young
        people in London, UK, we demonstrate a pragmatic approach to strengthening
        both internal and external validity in evaluations through integrating the

        \       <dc:description> Place and health researchers are increasingly interested
        in integrating individuals' mobility and the experience they have with multiple
        settings in their studies. In practice, however, few tools exist which allow
        for rapid and accurate gathering of detailed information on the geographic
        location of places where people regularly undertake activities. We describe
        the development and validation of a new activity location questionnaire which
        can be useful in accounting for multiple environmental influences in large
        population health investigations. \n\n To develop the questionnaire, we relied
        on a literature review of similar data collection tools and on results of
        a pilot study wherein we explored content validity, test-retest reliability,
        and face validity. To estimate convergent validity, we used data from a study
        of users of a public bicycle share program conducted in Montreal, Canada in
        2011. We examined the spatial congruence between questionnaire data and data
        from three other sources: 1) one-week GPS tracks; 2) activity locations extracted
        from the GPS tracks; and 3) a prompted recall survey of locations visited
        during the day. Proximity and convex hull measures were used to compare questionnaire-derived
        data and GPS and prompted recall survey data. \n\n In the sample, 75% of questionnaire-reported
        activity locations were located within 400 meters of an activity location
        recorded on the GPS track or through the prompted recall survey. Results from
        convex hull analyses suggested questionnaire activity locations were more
        concentrated in space than GPS or prompted-recall locations. \n\n The new
        questionnaire has high convergent validity and can be used to accurately collect
        data on regular activity spaces in terms of locations regularly visited. The
        methods, measures, and findings presented provide new material to further
        study mobility in place and health research. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>BioMed

        on a single, residential, context overlooks the fact that individuals are
        mobile and experience other settings in the course of their daily activities.
        Socio-economic characteristics are associated with activity patterns, as well
        as with the quality of places where certain groups conduct activities, i.e.
        their non-residential activity space. Examining how measures of exposure to
        resources, and inequalities thereof, compare between residential and non-residential
        contexts is required. Baseline data from 1890 young adults (18-25 years-old)
        participating in the Interdisciplinary Study of Inequalities in Smoking, Montreal,
        Canada (2011-2012), were analyzed. Socio-demographic and activity location
        data were collected using a validated, self-administered questionnaire. Area-level
        material deprivation was measured within 500-m\_road-network buffer zones
        around participants' residential and activity locations. Deprivation scores
        in the residential area and non-residential activity space were compared between
        social groups. Multivariate linear regression was used to estimate associations
        between individual- and area-level characteristics and non-residential activity
        space deprivation, and to explore whether these characteristics attenuated
        the education-deprivation association. Participants in low educational categories
        lived and conducted activities in more disadvantaged areas than university
        students/graduates. Educational inequalities in exposure to area-level deprivation
        were larger in the non-residential activity space than in the residential
        area for the least educated, but smaller for the intermediate group. Adjusting
        for selected covariates such as transportation resources and residential deprivation
        did not significantly attenuate the education-deprivation associations. Results
        support the existence of social isolation in residential areas and activity
        locations, whereby less educated individuals tend to be confined to more disadvantaged
        areas than their more educated counterparts. They also highlight the relevance
        of investigating both residential and non-residential contexts when studying
        inequalities in health-relevant exposures. \n\n</dc:description>\n        <dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher>\n

        observation is increasingly used as a method to measure neighbourhood characteristics
        thought to influence health inequalities. This article reports on the theory-driven
        development of a new observation tool composed of reflective indicators of
        neighbourhood characteristics believed to influence inequalities in smoking.
        We also report the results of generalisability analyses conducted to estimate
        the reliability (inter-rater reliability and temporal stability) of the observation
        tool. We use the reliability results to reflect on the quality of the measures
        and on the theoretical anchors of the tool. We conclude by making recommendations
        to improve measures collected through systematic observation. \n\n</dc:description>\n
