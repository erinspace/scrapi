        of three aspects of sentence structure in Classical Greek (henceforth CG)
        dramatic poetry: order of the main sentence elements (subject, verb, and object)
        within the clause, the emphatic position at the start of the clause, and the
        structure of inter-clausal linking. It is argued that these three features,
        usually considered separately, are interdependent, and that intra-clausal
        word order is directly related to the structure of compound and complex sentences.
        \ The discussion undertakes a systematic survey of subject, verb, and object
        order in a corpus of texts,  proposes an explanation for the observed order,
        and develops a model which explains how prominence within the clause is exploited
        in clause linking to produce the complement structures observed in Homeric
        and tragic complementation.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This work was

        early April 2013 I had the opportunity to examine stone EM 10300 in the Epigraphical
        Museum Athens.   The inscription, originally from Lamia in the southern periphery
        of Thessaly, was first published by Stephanos A. KOUMANOUDIS in the Greek
        periodical ???????? ??? ????????? 24 October 1864 (No. 541) after a copy made
        in situ by A. BLASTOS.   Two years later the stone had been brought to the
        National Archaeological Museum in Athens, and P. EUSTRATIADIS made a revised
        publication of the text in the same periodical, 22 December 1866 (No. 617),
        based on an autopsy of the stone.  Because ???????? ??? ????????? did not
        have wide circulation, Basilius LATISCHEW (Vasilii LATYSHEV) re-published
        the inscription in the Mitteilungen des Deutschen arch?ologischen Instituts
        No. 7 1882, along with one other Lamian proxeny decree (now IG IX,2 60), made
        on the basis of his own autopsy of the stone and provided in his publication
        an apparatus and minimal commentary on the dating of the inscription.   The
        inscription was last edited in IG IX,2 (1908) by Otto KERN from a squeeze.
        \ For the reason that no substantial commentary on this inscription currently
        exists, and because some relatively recently proposed restorations seem unlikely
        based on the examination of the actual stone, I present here a new edition
        of the text with a brief philological commentary.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2014-11-05T10:22:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-11-05T10:22:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:type>published

        all attested periods of the Ancient Thessalian dialect there are two mid-long
        vowels, written as &lt;E&gt; and &lt;O&gt; in the archaic epichoric alphabet
        and &lt;EI&gt; and &lt;OY&gt; in the Ionic alphabet. Traditionally the Ionic
        alphabet spellings have been explained as raised mid-high vowels /e?/ and
        /o?/. This paper problematizes this assumption, examining evidence from inscriptions
        transitional between the two scripts, and proposes that the spellings &lt;??&gt;
        and &lt;??&gt; may be plausibly interpreted instead as a specifically Thessalian
        standardized orthography for central-mid vowels /e??/ and /o??/.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-06-01T11:28:36Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-06-01T11:28:36Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:type>published

        effectiveness of fiscal policy to in uence vehicle purchases for emissions
        reductions in private passenger road transport depends on its ability to incentivise
        consumers to make choices oriented towards lower emissions vehicles. However,
        car purchase choices are known to be strongly socially determined, and this
        sector is highly diverse due to significant socio-economic differences between
        consumer groups. Here, we present a comprehensive dataset and analysis of
        the structure of the 2012 private passenger vehicle  eet-years in six major
        economies across the World (UK, USA, China, India, Japan and Brazil) in terms
        of price, engine size and emissions distributions. We argue that choices and
        aggregate elasticities of substitution can be predicted using this data, enabling
        to evaluate the effectiveness of potential fiscal and technological change
        policies on  eet-year emissions reductions. We provide tools to do so based
        on the distributive structure of prices and emissions in segments of a diverse
        market, both for conventional as well as unconventional engine technologies.
        We find that markets differ significantly between nations, and that correlations
        between engine sizes, emissions and prices exist strongly in some markets
        and not strongly in others. We furthermore find that markets for unconventional
        engine technologies have patchy coverages of varying levels. These findings
        are interpreted in terms of policy strategy.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>We

        than 100 loci have been identified for age at menarche by genome-wide association
        studies; however, collectively these explain only ~3% of the trait variance.
        Here we test two overlooked sources of variation in 192,974 European ancestry
        women: low-frequency protein-coding variants and X-chromosome variants. Five
        missense/nonsense variants (in ALMS1/LAMB2/TNRC6A/TACR3/PRKAG1) are associated
        with age at menarche (minor allele frequencies 0.08?4.6%; effect sizes 0.08?1.25
        years per allele; P&lt;5 ? 10^?8). In addition, we identify common X-chromosome
        loci at IGSF1 (rs762080, P=9.4 ? 10^?13) and FAAH2 (rs5914101, P=4.9 ? 10^?10).
        Highlighted genes implicate cellular energy homeostasis, post-transcriptional
        gene silencing and fatty-acid amide signalling. A frequently reported mutation
        in TACR3 for idiopathic hypogonatrophic hypogonadism (p.W275X) is associated
        with 1.25-year-later menarche (P=2.8 ? 10^?11), illustrating the utility of
        population studies to estimate the penetrance of reportedly pathogenic mutations.
        Collectively, these novel variants explain ~0.5% variance, indicating that
        these overlooked sources of variation do not substantially explain the ?missing
        heritability? of this complex trait.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>UK

        grain (RE)-Ba-Cu-O (RE: Sm, Gd, Y) high temperature superconductors are able
        to generate high magnetic fields. However, the relatively high cost of the
        raw materials and the low yield of the manufacturing process have impeded
        the development of practical applications of these materials to date. This
        article describes a simple, reliable and economical method of recycling failed
        bulk (RE)-Ba-Cu-O (RE: Sm, Gd, Y) samples. Sixty-four failed bulk samples,
        with diameters up to 31 mm, were recycled with a yield of 90%. The key innovation
        in this recycling process involves reintroducing the liquid phase into the
        melt process, which is normally lost during the primary peritectic processing
        of these materials. This enables the direct re-growth of failed samples from
        solid form without the need for re-grinding into powder. We also demonstrate
        that the superconducting performance and microstructure of the recycled samples
        is similar to that of the primary grown samples.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>We

        fracture risk is known to be related to material properties of the proximal
        femur, but fracture prediction studies adding richer quantitative computed
        tomography (QCT) measures to dual energy X-ray (DXA)-based methods have shown
        limited improvement. Fracture types have distinct relationships to predictors,
        but few studies have sub-divided fracture into types, since this necessitates
        regional measurements and more fracture cases. This work makes use of cortical
        bone mapping (CBM) to accurately assess, with no prior anatomical presumptions,
        the distribution of properties related to fracture type. CBM uses QCT data
        to measure the cortical and trabecular properties, accurate even for thin
        cortices below the imaging resolution. The osteoporotic fractures in men (MrOS)
        study is a predictive case-cohort study of men over 65: we analyse 99 fracture
        cases (44 trochanteric and 55 femoral neck) compared to a cohort of 308, randomly
        selected from 5,994. To our knowledge, this is the largest QCT-based predictive
        hip fracture study to date, and the first to incorporate CBM analysis into
        fracture prediction. We demonstrate that both cortical mass surface density,
        and endocortical trabecular BMD, show significant difference in fracture cases
        vs. cohort, in regions appropriate to fracture type. We incorporate these
        regions into predictive models using Cox proportional hazards regression to
        estimate hazard ratios, and logistic regression to estimate area under the
        receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Adding CBM to DXA-based BMD
        leads to a small but significant (p?&lt;?0.005) improvement in model prediction
        for any fracture, with AUC increasing from 0.78 to 0.79, assessed using leave-one-out
        cross-validation. For specific fracture types, the improvement is more significant
        (p?&lt;?0.0001), with AUC increasing from 0.71 to 0.77 (trochanteric fractures)
        and 0.76 to 0.82 (femoral neck fractures). In contrast, adding DXA-based BMD
        to a CBM-based predictive model does not result in any significant improvement.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The

        paper argues for an approach to flood alleviation design that considers the
        need not only for technical knowledge, but also a social perspective.  It
        is predicted that more intense rainfall and rising sea levels will result
        in a greater number of people vulnerable to flood events.  Flood alleviation
        design in the UK is often focused upon technical and cost-effective solutions,
        and consideration of social impact is seen as secondary.  This paper examines
        how the social value of a UK flood alleviation scheme is perceived and discussed,
        by the local community and by those responsible for the design of the scheme,
        and exposes differences in perceptions both between and within these two groups.
        \ It recommends a future approach in which an understanding of the social
        value of a flood alleviation scheme is first co-produced with the community
        affected, enabling the design of a socially acceptable and successful project.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The

        this paper a novel single-pixel method for coherent imaging through an endoscopic
        fiber bundle is presented. The use of a single-pixel detector allows greater
        sensitivity over a wider range of wavelengths, which could have significant
        applications in endoscopic fluorescence microscopy. First, the principle of
        lensless focussing at the distal end of a coherent fiber bundle is simulated
        to examine the impact of pixelation at microscopic scales. Next, an experimental
        optical correlator system using spatial light modulators (SLMs) is presented.
        A simple contrast imaging method of characterizing and compensating phase
        aberrations introduced by fiber bundles is described. Experimental results
        are then presented showing that our phase compensation method enables characterization
        of the optical phase profile of individual fiberlets. After applying this
        correction, early results demonstrating the ability of the system to electronically
        adjust the focal plane at the distal end of the fiber bundle are presented.
        The structural similarity index (SSIM) between the simulated image and the
        experimental focus-adjusted image increases noticeably when the phase correction
        is applied and the retrieved image is visually recognizable. Strategies to
        improve image quality are discussed.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>G.

        disorders are highly heritable but few genetic risk variants have been consistently
        replicated in molecular genetic association studies. The common method of
        defining psychiatric phenotypes in molecular genetic research is either a
        summation of symptom scores or binary threshold score representing risk of
        diagnosis. Psychometric latent variable methods can improve the precision
        of psychiatric phenotypes, especially when the data structure is not straightforward.
        &#13;\nUsing data from the British 1946 birth cohort, we compared summary
        scores with psychometric modelling based on the General Health Questionnaire
        (GHQ-28) scale for affective symptoms in an association analysis of 27 candidate
        genes (249 SNPs). The psychometric method utilized a bi-factor model that
        partitioned the phenotype variances into five orthogonal latent variable factors,
        in accordance with the multidimensional data structure of the GHQ-28 involving
        somatic, social, anxiety and depression domains. Results showed that, compared
        with the summation approach, the affective symptoms defined by the bi-factor
        psychometric model had a higher number of associated SNPs of larger effect
        sizes. These results suggest that psychometrically-defined mental health phenotypes
        can reflect the dimensions of complex phenotypes better than summation scores,
        and therefore offer a useful approach in genetic association investigations.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        marine world is incredibly rich in brilliant and intense colours. Photonic
        structures are found in many different species and provide extremely complex
        optical responses that cannot be achieved solely by pigments. In this study
        we examine the cuticular structure of the red alga Chondrus crispus (Irish
        Moss) using anatomical and optical approaches. We experimentally measure the
        optical response of the multilayer structure in the cuticle. Using finite-difference
        time-domain modelling, we demonstrate conclusively for the first time that
        the dimensions and organisation of lamellae are responsible for the blue structural
        coloration on the surface of the fronds. Comparison of material along the
        apical-basal axis of the frond demonstrates that structural colour is confined
        to the tips of the thalli and show definitively that a lack of structural
        colour elsewhere corresponds with a reduction in the number of lamellae and
        the regularity of their ordering. Moreover, by studying the optical response
        for different hydration conditions, we demonstrate that the cuticular structure
        is highly porous and that the presence of water plays a critical role in its
        ability to act as a structural light reflector.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The

        comparison for the purposes of selection, averaging and validation is a problem
        found throughout statistics. Within the Bayesian paradigm, these problems
        all require the calculation of the posterior probabilities of models within
        a particular class. Substantial progress has been made in recent years, but
        difficulties remain in the implementation of existing schemes. This paper
        presents adaptive sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling strategies to characterise
        the posterior distribution of a collection of models, as well as the parameters
        of those models. Both a simple product estimator and a combination of SMC
        and a path sampling estimator are considered and existing theoretical results
        are extended to include the path sampling variant. A novel approach to the
        automatic specification of distributions within SMC algorithms is presented
        and shown to outperform the state of the art in this area. The performance
        of the proposed strategies is demonstrated via an extensive empirical study.
        Comparisons with state of the art algorithms show that the proposed algorithms
        are always competitive, and often substantially superior to alternative techniques,
        at equal computational cost and considerably less application-specific implementation
        effort.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>AJ was supported by EPSRC grant

        Syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairments
        in social interaction and communication, alongside the presence of unusually
        repetitive, restricted interests and stereotyped behaviour. Individuals with
        AS have no delay in cognitive and language development. It is a subset of
        Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC), which are highly heritable and has a population
        prevalence of approximately 1%. Few studies have investigated the genetic
        basis of AS. To address this gap in the literature, we performed a genome-wide
        pooled DNA association study to identify candidate loci in 612 individuals
        (294 cases and 318 controls) of Caucasian ancestry, using the Affymetrix?
        GeneChip Human Mapping version 6.0 array. We identified 11 SNPs that had a
        p-value below 1x10-5. These SNPs were independently genotyped in the same
        sample. Three of the SNPs (rs1268055, rs7785891 and rs2782448) were nominally
        significant, though none remained significant after Bonferroni correction.
        Two of our top three SNPs (rs7785891 and rs2782448) lie in loci previously
        implicated in ASC. However, investigation of the three SNPs in the ASC genome-wide
        association dataset from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium indicated that
        these three SNPs were not significantly associated with ASC. The effect sizes
        of the variants were modest, indicating that our study was not sufficiently
        powered to identify causal variants with precision.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        the final stages of erythropoiesis, lineage-restricted progenitors mature
        over&#13;\nthree to five cell divisions culminating with withdrawal from the
        cell cycle and the loss of&#13;\nmost organelles, including mitochondria and
        nuclei. Recent genome wide association&#13;\nstudies to associate haematological
        parameters with SNPs in human populations have&#13;\nidentified several SNPs
        near or within FBXO7 with erythrocyte phenotypes. Fbxo7 encodes a&#13;\nmulti-functional
        F-box protein known to bind p27 and participate in selective mitophagy.&#13;\nOne
        SNP causes an amino acid substitution (Met115Ile) and is associated with smaller
        RBC&#13;\nsize. We find the less common IIe115 allele of Fbxo7 binds less
        efficiently to p27, and cells&#13;\nexpressing this allele proliferate faster
        than cells expressing Met115. We show an&#13;\nerythroleukemic cell line with
        reduced Fbxo7 expression fails to stabilize p27 levels, exit the&#13;\ncell
        cycle and produce haemoglobin. In addition, mice deficient for Fbxo7 expression
        are&#13;\nanaemic due to a reduction in erythrocyte numbers, and this is associated
        with lower p27&#13;\nlevels, increased numbers of late-stage erythroblasts
        with &gt;2N DNA content, and delayed&#13;\nmitophagy during terminal differentiation.
        Collectively, these data support an important&#13;\nphysiological, cell cycle
        regulatory role for Fbxo7 during erythropoiesis.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        paper describes the development of a model for classifying the different type
        of  ?design demonstrator? that might be used in translating scientific activity
        from the  laboratory to the market. Two detailed case studies are described
        in which designers  worked closely with scientists. In one of the projects,
        the scientists were seeking to commercialise their research. In the other,
        the research was at an early stage and the  scientists had not considered
        commercialisation. Different types of physical artefact produced in these
        collaborative projects were analysed to identify the extent to which they
        might contribute to science, technology, application or market. Evidence indicates
        that demonstrators might fulfil multiple purposes and that the translation
        from science  to market is more complicated than is often shown in linear
        models. An original classification of the role of demonstrators through this
        journey is provided.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This work was funded

        and analytical characterization related to the formation mechanism of Au-Pt

        Swaps are often used to encourage healthier food choices, but there is little
        evidence of their effectiveness. The current study assessed the impact of
        offering swaps on groceries purchased within a bespoke online supermarket;
        specifically the objective was to measure the impact on energy density (ED)
        of food purchases following the offer of lower ED alternatives (a) at point
        of selection or at checkout, and (b) with or without explicit consent to receive
        swap prompts Method Participants were asked to complete a 12-item shopping
        task within an online shopping platform, developed for studying food purchasing.
        1610 adults were randomly assigned to a no swap control condition or to one
        of four interventions: consented swaps at selection; consented swaps at checkout;
        imposed swaps at selection; or imposed swaps at checkout. Each swap presented
        two lower ED options from the same category as the participant?s chosen food.
        Swap acceptance rate and purchased food ED were the primary outcomes. Results
        Of the mean 12.36 (SD 1.26) foods purchased, intervention participants were
        offered a mean of 4.1 (SD 1.68) swaps, with the potential to reduce the ED
        of purchased food (effect (95 % CI): ?83 kJ/100 g (?110 ? -56), p?=?&amp;lt;0.0001).
        A median of one swap (IQR 0 to 2) was accepted, not significantly reducing
        the purchased food ED (effect (95 % CI): ?24 kJ/100 g (4 ? -52), p?=?0.094).
        More swaps were accepted when offered at selection than at checkout (OR (95
        % CI)?=?1.224 (1.11 ? 1.35), p?&amp;lt;?0.0001), but no differences were seen
        with consent. Purchased food ED was unaffected by point of swap or consent,
        but reduced with number of swaps accepted (effect per swap (95 % CI)?=??24
        kJ/100 g (?35 ? -14), p?&amp;lt;?0.0001). Conclusion Within category swaps
        did not reduce the ED of food purchases reflecting the observation that the
        use of swaps within an on-line shopping platform offered small potential gains
        in ED and a minority was accepted.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        flexibility of insect adhesive pads is crucial for their ability to attach
        on rough surfaces. Here&#13;\nwe use transparent substrates with micropillars
        to test in adult cockroaches (Nauphoeta cinerea)&#13;\nwhether and how the
        stiffness of smooth adhesive pads changes when shear forces are applied, and
        whether the insect?s age has any influence. We found that during pulls towards
        the body, the pad?s ability to conform to the surface microstructures was
        improved in comparison to a contact without shear, suggesting that shear forces
        make the pad more compliant. The mechanism underlying this shear-dependent
        increase in compliance is still unclear. The effect was not explained by viscoelastic
        creep, changes in normal pressure, or shear-induced pad rolling, which brings
        new areas of cuticle into surface contact. Adhesive pads were significantly
        stiffer in older cockroaches. Stiffness increased most rapidly in cockroaches
        aged between 2.5 and 4 months. The increase in stiffness is likely based on
        wear and repair of the delicate adhesive cuticle. Recent wear (visualised
        by methylene blue staining) was not age-dependent, whereas permanent damage
        (visible as brown scars) accumulated with age, reducing the pads? flexibility.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        the incidence of cutaneous melanoma has been reported to be highest in the
        summer and lowest in the winter. Northern Irish data suggested seasonal variation
        for women only, especially those with thinner melanomas, sited on limbs. We
        interrogated two larger UK cancer registries for temporal differences in melanoma
        diagnosis and associated patient characteristics.&#13;\nMethods&#13;\nMelanomas
        diagnosed from 2006 to 2010 in the Eastern England and Scottish cancer registries
        (n=11,611) were analysed by month of diagnosis, patient demographics and melanoma
        characteristics, using descriptive and multivariate modelling methods.&#13;\nResults&#13;\nMore
        patients with melanoma were diagnosed in the summer months (June 9.9%, July
        9.7%, August 9.8%) than the winter months (December 7.2%, January 7.2%, February
        7.1%) and this pattern was consistent in both regions.  There was evidence
        that the seasonal patterns varied by sex (p=0.015), melanoma thickness (p=0.002),
        body site (p=0.006), and type (superficial spreading melanomas p=0.005). The
        seasonal variation was greatest for diagnosis of melanomas occurring on the
        limbs.&#13;\nConclusion&#13;\nThis study has confirmed seasonal variation
        in melanoma diagnosis in Eastern England and Scotland across almost all population
        demographics and melanoma characteristics studied, with higher numbers diagnosed
        in the summer months, particularly on the limbs. Seasonal patterns in skin
        awareness and related help-seeking are likely to be implicated. Targeted patient
        interventions to increase sun awareness and encourage year-long skin inspection
        are warranted.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The paper was materially

        It first appeared from BMJ via http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.h3576</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Background
        Current evidence is insufficient for prospective associations of consuming
        sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), artificially-sweetened beverages (ASB), and
        fruit juice with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for which adiposity is adequately controlled.
        The population attributable fraction (PAF) for T2D remains unknown.&#13;\nObjectives
        To examine these prospective associations before and after adjustment for
        adiposity; and to estimate PAF for T2D due to SSB consumption in the United
        States and the United Kingdom.&#13;\nData sources and eligibility Prospective
        studies of non-diabetic adults, published until February 2014, were identified
        by searching PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, and Web-of-Knowledge. The PAF was estimated
        in national surveys in the US, 2009-2010 (n=4,729 representing 189.1 million
        non-diabetic adults) and the UK, 2008-2012 (n=1,932 representing 44.7 million).&#13;\nSynthesis
        methods Random-effects meta-analysis and survey analysis for PAF due to SSB
        consumption.&#13;\nResults Prespecified information was extracted from seventeen
        cohorts (38,253 cases/10,126,754 person-years). Higher SSB consumption was
        associated with higher incidence of T2D by 18% per one serving/day (95% confidence
        interval=8.8 to 28%, I2 for heterogeneity=89%) and 13% (5.8 to 21%, I2=79%)
        before and after adjustment for adiposity, respectively; for ASB, 25% (18
        to 33%, I2=70%) and 8% (2.1 to 15%, I2=64%); and for fruit juice, 5% (-1.0
        to 11%, I2=58%) and 7% (0.8 to 14%, I2=51%). Potential sources of heterogeneity
        or bias were not evident for SSB. For ASB, publication bias and residual confounding
        were indicated. For fruit juice, the finding was non-significant in studies
        ascertaining T2D objectively (Pheterogeneity=0.008). Under specified assumptions
        for PAF, of 20.9 million events of T2D predicted to occur over 10 years in
        the US (absolute event rate=11.0%), 1.8 million would be attributable to SSB
        consumption (PAF=8.7%, 95% confidence interval=3.9 to 12.9%); and of 2.6 million
        events in the UK (absolute event rate=5.8%), 79 thousand would be attributable
        to SSB consumption (PAF=3.6%, 1.7 to 5.6%).&#13;\nLimitations Residual confounding
        and limited evidence of causality.\t&#13;\nConclusions Habitual SSB consumption
        was associated with greater T2D incidence, independently of adiposity. Although
        ASB and fruit juice also showed positive associations with T2D incidence,
        the findings were likely to involve bias. Nonetheless, both ASB and fruit
        juice were unlikely to be healthy alternatives to SSB for the prevention of
        T2D. Under assumption of causality, SSB consumption over years may be related
        to a substantial number of cases of new-onset diabetes.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The

        dietary behaviours may contribute to obesity additionally to energy imbalance.
        Both positive and null associations of snacking and BMI have been reported,
        but the association of snacking and total adiposity or pattern of fat deposition
        remains unevaluated. The objective was to investigate associations between
        snacking frequency and detailed adiposity measurements. 10092 adults resident
        in Cambridgeshire, England, self-completed eating pattern snacking frequency,
        food-frequency and physical activity questionnaires. Measurements included
        anthropometry, body composition using DEXA scan and ultrasound, and assessment
        of physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) using heart-rate and movement
        sensing. Linear regression analyses were conducted adjusted for age, socio-demographics,
        dietary quality, energy intake, PAEE and screen-time, by sex and BMI status.
        Among normal weight individuals (BMI&lt;25kg/m2) each additional snack was
        inversely associated with obesity measures: lower total body fat in men and
        women [-0.41(95%CI, -0.74,-0.07)%, -0.41(-0.67,-0.15)% respectively] and waist
        circumference [-0.52(-0.90,-0.14)cm] in men. Contrastingly, among the overweight/obese
        (BMI?25kg/m2), there were positive associations: higher waist circumference
        [0.80(0.34,0.28)cm] and subcutaneous fat [0.06(0.01,0.110cm] in women and
        waist circumference [0.37(0.00,0.73)cm] in men. Comparing intakes of snack-type
        foods showed that participants with BMI?25kg/m2 had higher intakes of crisps,
        sweets, chocolates, ice-creams and lower intakes of yoghurt and nuts than
        normal weight participants. Adjusting for these foods in a model that included
        a BMI-snacking interaction term attenuated all associations to null. Snacking
        frequency may be associated with higher or lower adiposity, with the direction
        of association being differential by BMI status and dependent on snack-food
        choice. Improving snack choices could contribute to anti-obesity public health
        interventions.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The Fenland Study is funded

        senescence is a widespread stress response and is widely considered to be
        an alternative cancer therapeutic goal. Unlike apoptosis, senescence is composed
        of a diverse set of sub-phenotypes; depending on which of its associated effector
        programs are engaged. Here we establish a simple and sensitive, cell-based,
        pro-senescence screen with detailed validation assays. We have characterized
        the screen using a focused tool compound kinase inhibitor library. We have
        identified a series of compounds that induce different types of senescence,
        including a unique phenotype associated with irregularly shaped nuclei and
        the progressive accumulation of pseudo-G1 tetraploidy in human diploid fibroblasts.
        Downstream analyses showed that all those compounds that induced tetraploid
        senescence, inhibited Aurora kinase B (AURKB). AURKB is the catalytic component
        of the chromosome passenger complex, which is involved in correct chromosome
        alignment and segregation, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), and cytokinesis.
        Although aberrant mitosis and senescence have been linked, a specific characterization
        of AURKB in the context of senescence is still required. This proof-ofprinciple
        study suggests that our protocol is capable of amplifying tetraploid senescence,
        which can be observed only in a small population of oncogenic RAS-induced
        senescence, and provides additional justification for AURKB as a cancer therapeutic
        target.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This work was supported by the University

        remodelling proteins are essential for different aspects of metazoan biology,
        yet functional details of why these proteins are important are lacking. While
        it is possible to describe the biochemistry of how they remodel chromatin,
        their chromatin binding profiles in cell lines, and gene expression changes
        upon loss of a given protein, in very few cases can this easily translate
        into an understanding of how the function of that protein actually influences
        a developmental process. Here we investigate how the chromatin remodelling
        protein CHD 4 facilitates the first lineage decision in mammalian embryogenesis.
        Embryos lacking CHD4 can form a morphologically normal early blastocyst, but
        are unable to successfully complete the first lineage decision and make &#13;\nfunctional
        trophectoderm ( TE). In the absence of a functional TE, CHD4 mutant blastocysts
        do not implant and are hence not viable. By measuring transcript levels in
        single cells from early embryos, we show that CHD4 influences the frequency
        at which unspecified cells in preimplantation stage embryos express lineage
        markers prior to the execution of this first lineage decision. In the absence
        of CHD4 this frequency is increased in 16-cell embryos, and by the blastocyst
        stage cells fail to properly adopt a TE gene expression programme. We propose
        that CHD 4 allows cells to undertake lineage commitment in vivo by modulating
        the frequency with which lineage specification genes are expressed. This provides
        novel insight both into how lineage decisions are made in mammalian cells,
        and how a chromatin remodelling protein functions to facilitate lineage commitment.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-06-30T11:52:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-06-30T11:52:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-06-26</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:type>published

        Invasion of normal brain is a cardinal feature of glioblastomas (GBM) and
        a major cause of treatment failure. Diffusion tensor MR (DTI) can identify
        invasive regions. The aim of this study was to use perfusion and MR spectroscopy
        to compare the DTI-defined invasive and non-invasive regions. Materials and
        Methods: 50 GBM patients were imaged pre-operatively at 3 T with anatomic
        sequences, DTI, dynamic susceptibility perfusion MR (DSCI) and multivoxel
        spectroscopy. The DTI and DSCI data were co-registered to the spectroscopy
        data and regions of interest were made in the invasive (determined by DTI),
        non-invasive regions and normal brain. Values of relative cerebral blood volume
        (rCBV), N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), myoinositol (mI), total choline (Cho) and
        glutamate+glutamine (Glx) normalized to creatine (Cr) and Cho/NAA were measured
        at each ROI. Results: Invasive regions showed significant increases in rCBV
        suggesting angiogenesis (invasive rCBV 1.64 [95%CI 1.5?1.76] vs. non-invasive
        1.14 [1.09-1.18]; P&lt;0.001), Cho/Cr (invasive 0.42 [0.38?0.46] vs. non-invasive
        0.35 [0.31-0.38]; P=0.02) and Cho/NAA (invasive 0.54 [0.41-0.68] vs. non-invasive
        0.37 [0.29-0.45]; P=&lt;0.03) suggesting proliferation, and Glx/Cr (invasive
        1.54 [1.27-1.82] vs. non-invasive 1.3 [1.13-1.47]; P=0.028) suggesting glutamate
        release; and a significantly reduced NAA/Cr (invasive 0.95 [0.85-1.05] vs.
        non-invasive 1.19 [1.06-1.31]; P=0.008). The mI/Cr was not different between
        the three ROIs (invasive 1.2 [0.99-1.41] vs. non-invasive 1.3 [1.14-1.46];
        P=0.68). In the non-invasive regions, the values were not different from normal
        brain. Conclusions: Combining DTI to identify the invasive region with perfusion
        and spectroscopy, we can identify changes in invasive regions not seen in
        non-invasive regions.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This study was funded

        addition to causing distress and disability to the individual, neuropsychiatric
        disorders are also extremely expensive to society and governments. These disorders
        are both common and debilitating and impact on cognition, functionality and
        wellbeing. Cognitive enhancing drugs, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and
        methylphenidate, are used to treat cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer?s disease
        and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, respectively. Other cognitive
        enhancers include specific computerized cognitive training and devices. An
        example of a novel form of cognitive enhancement using the technological advancement
        of a game on an iPad which also acts to increase motivation is presented.
        Cognitive enhancing drugs, such as methylphenidate and modafinil, which were
        developed as treatments, are increasingly being used by healthy people. Modafinil
        not only affects ?cold? cognition, but also improves ?hot? cognition, such
        as emotion recognition and task-related motivation. The lifestyle use of ?smart
        drugs? raises both safety concerns as well as ethical issues, including coercion
        and increasing disparity in society. As a society, we need to consider which
        forms of cognitive enhancement (e.g. pharmacological, exercise, life-long
        learning) are acceptable and for which groups (e.g. military, doctors) under
        what conditions (e.g. war, shift work) and by what methods we would wish to

        devices for sensing and computing applications require coherent quantum systems,
        which can be manipulated in fast and robust ways [1]. Such quantum control
        is typically achieved using external electromagnetic fields, which drive the
        system's orbital [2], charge [3] or spin [4, 5] degrees of freedom. However,
        most existing approaches require complex and unwieldy gate structures, and
        with few exceptions [6, 7] are limited to the regime of weak coherent driving.
        Here, we present a novel approach to coherently drive a single electronic
        spin using internal strain fields [8-10] in an integrated quantum device.
        Specifically, we employ time-varying strain in a diamond cantilever to induce
        long-lasting, coherent oscillations of an embedded Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centre
        spin. We perform direct spectroscopy of the phonon-dressed states emerging
        from this drive and observe hallmarks of the sought-after strong drivng regime
        [6, 11], where the spin rotation frequency exceeds the spin splitting. Additionally,
        we employ our continuous strain driving to significantly enhance the NV's
        spin coherence time [12]. Our room-temperature experiments thereby constitute
        an important step towards strain-driven, integrated quantum devices and open
        new perspectives to investigate unexplored regimes of strongly driven multi-level
        systems [13] and to study exotic spin dynamics in hybrid spin-oscillator devices.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>We

        amplitude vibration regimes can cause significant damage to oilwell drillstrings:
        torsional stick-slip oscillation, forward whirl and backward whirl are each
        associated with different kinds of damage. There is a need for models of drillstring
        dynamics that can predict this variety of phenomena that are: efficient enough
        to carry out parametric studies; simple enough to provide insight into the
        underlying physics, and which retain sufficient detail to correlate to real
        drillstrings. The modelling strategy presented in this paper attempts to balance
        these requirements. It includes the dynamics of the full length of the drillstring
        over a wide bandwidth but assumes that the main nonlinear effects are due
        to spatially localised regions of strong nonlinearity, for example at the
        drillbit cutting interface and at stabilisers where the borehole wall clearance
        is smallest. The equations of motion can be formed in terms of this reduced
        set of degrees of freedom, coupled to the nonlinear contact laws and solved
        by time-domain integration. Two implementations of this approach are presented,
        using (1) digital filters and (2) a Finite Element model to describe the linear
        dynamics. Choosing a sampling period that is less than the group delay between
        nonlinear degrees of freedom results in a decoupled set of equations that
        can be solved very efficiently. Several cases are presented which demonstrate
        a variety of phenomena, including stick-slip oscillation; forward whirl and
        backward whirl. Parametric studies are shown which reveal the conditions which
        lead to high amplitude vibration regimes, and an analytic regime boundary
        is derived for torsional stick-slip oscillation. The digital filter and Finite
        Element models are shown to be in good agreement and are similarly computationally
        efficient. The digital filter approach has the advantage of more intuitive
        interpretation, while the Finite Element model is more readily implemented
        using existing software packages.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The authors

        - see article]&#13;\nWe present an in silico study of the neuromorphic-computing
        behavior of the prototypical phase-change material, Ge2Sb2Te5, using ab initio
        molecular-dynamics simulations. Stepwise changes in structural order in response
        to temperature pulses of varying length and duration are observed, and a good
        reproduction of the spike-timing-dependent plasticity observed in nanoelectronic
        synapses is demonstrated. Short above-melting pulses lead to instantaneous
        loss of structural and chemical order, followed by delayed partial recovery
        upon structural relaxation. We also investigate the link between structural
        order and electrical and optical properties. These results pave the way toward
        a first-principles understanding of phase-change physics beyond binary switching.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>J.M.S.

        dissolution of silicate minerals by CO2?rich fluids and the subsequent precipitation
        of CO2 as carbonate minerals represent a means of permanently storing anthropogenic
        CO2 waste products in a solid and secure form. Modelling the progression of
        these reactions is hindered by our poor understanding of the rates of mineral
        dissolution-precipitation reactions and mineral surface properties in natural
        systems. This study evaluates the chemical evolution of groundwater flowing
        through a basalt aquifer, which forms part of the leaking CO2-charged system
        of the Blackfoot Volcanic Field in south-eastern Idaho, USA.  Reaction progress
        is modelled using changes in groundwater chemistry by inverse mass balance
        techniques. The CO2-promoted fluid-mineral reactions include the dissolution
        of primary plagioclase, orthoclase, pyroxene and gypsum which is balanced
        by the precipitation of secondary albite, calcite, zeolite, kaolinite and
        silica. Mineral mole transfers and groundwater flow rates estimated from hydraulic
        head data are used to determine the kinetics of plagioclase and orthoclase
        feldspar dissolution. Plagioclase surface area measurements were determined
        using the evolution of the U-series isotope ratios in the groundwater and
        are compared to published surface area measurements. Calculated rates of dissolution
        for plagioclase range from 2.4 x 10-12 to 4.6 x 10-16 mol/m2/s and orthoclase
        from 2.0 x 10-13 to 6.8 x 10-16 mol/m2/s respectively. These feldspar reaction
        rates, correlate with the degree of mineral-fluid disequilibrium and are similar
        to the dissolution rates for these mineral measured in other natural CO2-charged
        groundwater systems.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Carbon research at

        CdS quantum dots were produced by a reactive ligand stripping procedure and
        employed for photocatalytic H2 evolution in pH neutral solution. The rate
        of H2 generation of the ?bare? quantum dots was 175 times higher than that
        of the equivalent mercaptopropionic acid-capped quantum dots in the presence
        of a cobalt co-catalyst and Na2SO3 as sacrificial electron donor. Under optimised
        conditions, a turnover number of 58,000 mol H2 per mol Co and 29,000 mol H2
        per mol CdS quantum dots was achieved after 88 h of continuous solar light
        irradiation (? &gt; 420 nm, 1 sun intensity). Ligand removal is therefore
        a potent method to substantially enhance the photocatalytic performance of

        an optimization model for antenna selection and deployment in ceiling mounted,
        single and multi-cell RFID systems. The proposed model utilises a three-dimensional
        (3D) antenna radiation pattern, taking into consideration of both antenna
        half power beam width and downtilt angle. Specifically, we have analysed the
        effects of cell structures on detection probability in single-cell operation
        and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) in multi-cell scenario. Four cell structures
        have been studied, namely, triangular cells, conventional rectangular cells,
        offset rectangular cells and hexagonal cells. Several design examples are
        also presented to show how to use this model to find the optimal configuration
        to cover the maximum area with a minimum number of antennas for a single cell
        scenario, as well as the trade-offs that have to be made to achieve a reasonable
        SIR in multi-cell operation. We believe this optimization model provides new
        insights into the optimal deployment of single and multi-cell RFID systems.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        DamID is a powerful technique for identifying regions of the genome bound
        by a DNA-binding (or DNA-associated) protein. Currently no method exists for
        automatically processing next-generation sequencing DamID (DamID-seq) data,
        and the use of DamID-seq datasets with normalisation based on read-counts
        alone can lead to high background and the loss of bound signal. DamID-seq
        thus presents novel challenges in terms of normalisation and background minimisation.
        We describe here damidseq_pipeline, a software pipeline that performs automatic
        normalisation and background reduction on multiple DamID-seq FASTQ datasets.&#13;\n&#13;\nAvailability
        and implementation: Open-source and freely available from http://owenjm.github.io/damidseq_pipeline.
        The damidseq_pipeline is implemented in Perl and is compatible with any Unix-based
        operating system (e.g. Linux, Mac OSX).</dc:description>\n<dc:description>We

        of a series of zinc tetraphenyl porphyrins were synthesized and used as supramolecular
        receptors. Rotation around the porphyrin-meso phenyl bonds is restricted by
        installing ortho-chlorine substituents on the phenyl groups. The chlorine
        substituents allowed chromatographic separation of atropisomers, which did
        not interconvert at room temperature. The porphyrin meso phenyl groups were
        also equipped with phenol groups, which led to the formation of intramolecular
        H-bonds when the zinc porphyrins were bound to pyridine ligands equipped with
        ester or amide side arms. Binding of the pyridine ligands with the conformationally
        locked chloroporphyrins with was compared with the corresponding unsubstituted
        porphyrins, which are more flexible. The association constants of 150 zinc
        porphyrin-pyridine complexes were measured in two different solvents, toluene
        and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE). These association constants were then
        used to construct 120 chemical double mutant cycles to quantify the influence
        of chlorine substitution on the free energy of intramolecular H-bonds formed
        between the phenol side arms of the porphyrins and the ester or amide side
        arms of the pyridine ligands. Conformational restriction leads to increases
        in the stability of some complexes and decreases in the stability of others
        with variations in the free energy contribution due to intramolecular H-bonding
        of -5 to +6 kJ mol-1.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>We thank the EPSRC,

        &#13;\nTo examine the cross sectional and longitudinal relationship between
        cardiovascular risk factors and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in
        a large British cohort study.&#13;\n &#13;\nMethods: The EPIC Norfolk Eye
        study is nested in a larger prospective cohort study. Data on cardiovascular
        risk factors were collected at baseline (1993-1997) and follow up (2006-2011)
        via clinical examination, validated lifestyle questionnaires and serum blood
        samples. AMD was ascertained using standardised grading of fundus photographs
        at the follow up. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between
        baseline and follow up risk factors with AMD. &#13;\n&#13;\nResults: &#13;\n5,344
        pairs (62.0% of total 8623) of fundus photographs were of sufficient quality
        for grading of AMD in participants with mean age of 67.4 years old (range
        44-91) at diagnosis. There were 28 cases of late AMD (0.5%, 95% confidence
        interval (CI)=0.3-0.8%) and 645 cases of early AMD (12.1%, 95%CI=11.2-13.0.%).
        In multivariable analysis, older people with higher levels of baseline high
        density lipoprotein- cholesterol (HDL-C ) and  C-reactive protein (CRP) were
        more likely to have any signs of AMD, after adjusting for sex, education,
        smoking, and systolic blood pressure. In cross sectional analysis, only older
        age and higher HDL were significantly associated with AMD.&#13;\n&#13;\nConclusions.&#13;\nWe
        have found that older age and higher levels of CRP and HDL-C were associated
        with increased odds of AMD in this population in the longitudinal analysis,
        but older age and HDL-C, not CRP was significantly associated with AMD in
        the cross sectional analysis. The prevalence of AMD in this cohort was low
        compared to other cohorts in Europe, the US and Australia, and probably reflects
        the some selection biases in follow up participation as well as the low rate
        of smoking among our healthy participants.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>EPIC-Norfolk

        cells do not, in general, migrate. They maintain a fixed position relative
        to their neighbours, intimately linked through growth and differentiation.
        The mediator of this connection, the pectin-rich middle lamella, is deposited
        during cell division and maintained throughout the cell?s life to protect
        tissue integrity. The maintenance of adhesion requires cell wall modification
        and is dependent on the actin cytoskeleton. There are developmental processes
        that require cell separation, such as organ abscission, dehiscence, and ripening.
        In these instances, the pectin-rich middle lamella must be actively altered
        to allow cell separation, a process which also requires cell wall modification.
        In this review, we will focus on the role of pectin and its modification in
        cell adhesion and separation. Recent insights gained in pectin gel mechanics
        will be discussed in relation to existing knowledge of pectin chemistry as
        it relates to cell adhesion. As a whole, we hope to begin defining the physical
        mechanisms behind a cells? ability to hang on, and how it lets go.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The

        are highly complex polysaccharides abundant in plant primary cell walls. New
        analytical and microscopy techniques are revealing the composition and mechanical
        properties of the cell wall and increasing our knowledge on the topic. Progress
        in plant physiological research supports a link between cell wall pectin modifications
        and plant development and interactions with the environment. Homogalacturonan
        pectins, which are major components of the primary cell wall, have a potential
        for modifications such as methylesterification, as well as an ability to form
        cross-linked structures with divalent cations. This contributes to changing
        the mechanical properties of the cell wall. This review aims to give a comprehensive
        overview of the pectin component homogalacturonan, including its synthesis,
        modification, regulation and role in the plant cell wall.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The

        mass dampers (TMDs) are widely used to reduce vibrations in structures. However,
        very little research is available on the experimental investigation of TMDs
        and their performance in soilstructure systems. In this paper, a series of
        geotechnical centrifuge tests was conducted to investigate the effects of
        TMDs on the response of a multiple-storey sway frame structure undergoing
        dynamic soil-structure interaction (SSI). Structural responses were recorded
        for a wide range of input motion characteristics, damper configurations and
        soil profiles. The practicality associated with the use of TMDs in the damping
        of resonant structures in light of unexpected earthquake characteristics different
        from design earthquakes was experimentally demonstrated. Tuning a TMD to soil-structure
        system properties rather than fixed-base structural properties was found to
        double the improvement in damping and reduce the original peak response by
        nearly half. The potential effectiveness of a detuned mass damper in light
        of significant SSI was also demonstrated.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The

        for determining mechanisms of growth and toxicity. Nanopore sensing is an
        attractive solution for this problem since it gives information on aggregates?
        shapes with relatively high throughput for a single particle technology. In
        this paper we study the translocation of lysozyme fibrils through quartz glass
        nanopores. We demonstrate that, under appropriate salt and pH conditions,
        lysozyme fibrils translocate through bare quartz nanopores without causing
        significant clogging. This enables us to measure statistics on tens of thousands
        of translocations of lysozyme fibrils with the same nanopore and track their
        development over a time course of aggregation spanning 24h. Analysis of our
        events shows that the statistics are consistent with a simple bulk conductivity
        model for the passage of rods with a fixed cross sectional area through a
        conical glass nanopore.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>N.A.W.B. acknowledges

        formation of nanoscale amyloid fibrils from normally soluble proteins is a
        common form of self-assembly phenomenon that has fundamental connections with
        biological functions and human diseases. The kinetics of this process has
        been widely studied and exhibits on a macroscopic level three characteristic
        stages: a lag phase, a growth phase and a final plateau regime. The question
        of which molecular events take place during each one of these phases has been
        a central element in the quest for a mechanism of amyloid formation. In this
        review, we discuss the nature and molecular origin of the lag-phase in amyloid
        formation by making use of tools and concepts from physical chemistry, in
        particular from chemical reaction kinetics. We discuss how, in macroscopic
        samples, it has become apparent that the lag-phase is not a waiting time for
        nuclei to form. Rather, multiple parallel processes exist and typically millions
        of primary nuclei form during the lag phase from monomers in solution. Thus,
        the lag-time represents a time that is required for the nuclei that are formed
        early on in the reaction to grow and proliferate in order to reach an aggregate
        concentration that is readily detected in bulk assays. In many cases, this
        proliferation takes place through secondary nucleation, where fibrils may
        present a catalytic surface for the formation of new aggregates. Fibrils may
        also break (fragmentation) and thereby provide new ends for elongation. Thus,
        at least two - primary nucleation and elongation - and in many systems at
        least four - primary nucleation, elongation, secondary nucleation and fragmentation

        occur during the all three phases of the macroscopic aggregation process,
        albeit at different rates as governed by rate constants and by the concentration
        of reacting species at each point in time.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        of body surfaces can negatively affect many physiological functions. Insects
        have evolved different adaptations for removing contamination, including surfaces
        that allow passive self-cleaning and structures for active cleaning. Here,
        we study the function of the antenna cleaner in Camponotus rufifemur ants,
        a clamp-like structure consisting of a notch on the basitarsus facing a spur
        on the tibia, both bearing cuticular ?combs? and ?brushes?. The ants clamp
        one antenna tightly between notch and &#13;\nspur, pull it through, and subsequently
        clean the antenna cleaner itself with the mouthparts. We simulated cleaning
        strokes by moving notch or spur over antennae contaminated with fluorescent
        particles. The notch removed particles more efficiently than the spur, but
        both components eliminated &gt;60% of the particles with the first stroke.
        Ablation of bristles, brush and comb strongly reduced the efficiency, indicating
        that they are essential for cleaning. To study how comb and brush remove particles
        of different sizes, we contaminated antennae of living ants, and anaesthetized
        them immediately after they had performed the first cleaning stroke. Different
        sized beads were trapped in distinct zones of the notch, consistent with the
        gap widths between cuticular outgrowths. This suggests that the antenna cleaner
        operates like a series of sieves that remove the largest objects first, followed
        by smaller ones, down to the smallest particles that get caught by adhesion.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>To

        operating systems share a common kernel text section amongst all processes.
        It is not possible to perform kernel specialization or tuning such that different
        applications execute text optimized for their kernel use despite the benefits
        of kernel specialization for performance guided optimization, exokernels,
        kernel fastpaths, and cheaper hardware access. Current specialization primitives
        involve system wide changes to kernel text, which can have adverse effects
        on other processes sharing the kernel due to the global side-effects. We present
        shadow kernels: a primitive that allows multiple kernel text sections to coexist
        in a contemporary operating system. By remapping kernel virtual memory on
        a context-switch, or for individual system calls, we specialize the kernel
        on a fine-grained basis. Our implementation of shadow kernels uses the Xen
        hypervisor so can be applied to any operating system that runs on Xen.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        Antigenic characterization of influenza viruses is typically based on hemagglutination
        inhibition (HI) assay data of viral isolates tested against strain-specific
        post-infection ferret antisera. Here, similar virus characterizations were
        performed using first-infection human rather than ferret serology data.&#13;\nMethods:
        We screened sera collected between 1995 and 2011 from children between 9 and
        24 months of age for influenza virus antibodies, performed HI tests for the
        positive sera against 24 influenza viruses isolated between 1989 and 2011,
        and measured HI titers of 24 A/H3N2 ferret sera against the same panel of
        viruses. &#13;\nResults: Of the 17 positive human sera, 6 were high-responders,
        showing HI patterns that would be expected from primary infection antisera,
        while 11 sera had lower, more dispersed patterns of reactivity that are not
        easily explained. The antigenic map based on the high-responder human HI data
        was similar to the results using ferret data.&#13;\nConclusions: Although
        the overall structure of the ferret and human antigenic maps is similar, local
        differences in virus positions indicate that the human and ferret immune system
        might see antigenic properties of viruses differently. Further studies are
        needed to establish to what degree of detail ferret data provide equivalent
        patterns to human serological reactivity.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        animals communicate using sequences of discrete acoustic elements which can
        be complex, vary in their degree of stereotypy, and are potentially open-ended.
        Variation in sequences can provide important ecological, behavioural, or evolutionary
        information about the structure and connectivity of populations, mechanisms
        for vocal cultural evolution, and the underlying drivers responsible for these
        processes. Various mathematical techniques have been used to form a realistic
        approximation of sequence similarity for such tasks. &#13;\n2.\tHere, we use
        both simulated and empirical datasets from animal vocal sequences (rock hyrax,
        Procavia capensis; humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae; bottlenose dolphin,
        Tursiops truncatus; and Carolina chickadee, Poecile carolinensis) to test
        which of eight sequence analysis metrics are more likely to reconstruct the
        information encoded in the sequences, and to test the fidelity of estimation
        of model parameters, when the sequences are assumed to conform to particular
        statistical models. &#13;\n3.\tResults from the simulated data indicated that
        multiple metrics were equally successful in reconstructing the information
        encoded in the sequences of simulated individuals (Markov chains, n-gram models,
        repeat distribution, and edit distance), and data generated by different stochastic
        processes (entropy rate and n-grams). However, the string edit (Levenshtein)
        distance performed consistently and significantly better than all other tested
        metrics (including entropy, Markov chains, n-grams, mutual information) for
        all empirical datasets, despite being less commonly used in the field of animal
        acoustic communication. &#13;\n4.\tThe Levenshtein distance metric provides
        a robust analytical approach that should be considered in the comparison of
        animal acoustic sequences in preference to other commonly employed techniques
        (such as Markov chains, hidden Markov models, or Shannon entropy). The recent
        discovery that non-Markovian vocal sequences may be more common in animal
        communication than previously thought, provides a rich area for future research
        that requires non-Markovian based analysis techniques to investigate animal
        grammars and potentially the origin of human language.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>We

        BET surface area, cation exchange capacity and sorption of lead. The kinetics
        data were well fitted by the Pseudo second order model. The increase of biochar
        dosage increased the percentage of lead removal in solutions. The increase
        of initial solution pH increased the percentage of lead removal across the
        pH range of 2 - 10. The calculated maximum adsorption capacity of lead by
        Langmuir model were 47.66 and 30.04 mg/g for 0.15 mm and 2 mm samples. The
        adsorption capacities of different metals decreased in the order of lead &gt;
        nickel &gt; copper &gt; zinc calculated in mmol/g. This study suggests a great
        potential of biochars derived from British broadleaf hardwood to be applied
        in soil remediation.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-07-02T13:41:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-07-02T13:41:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-06-27</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:type>accepted

        article examines the scope for initiative and independent action that lies
        with school principals in Kazakhstan, with a particular focus on capacity
        building approaches. A framework drawn from Hargreaves (2001) and Dimmock
        (2012) guided our inquiry. The study is situated within a large collaborative
        project between three institutions: the University of Cambridge Faculty of
        Education, Nazarbayev University Graduate School of Education and Nazarbayev
        Intellectual Schools. A mixed method research design was used to collect data
        in 20 schools and 11 other educational organisations in six different geographical
        locations in Kazakhstan. The findings suggest that capacity building strategies
        are necessary if innovations are to be implemented across all schools. The
        article outlines the challenges involved in making school reform effective
        and draws on the ?capital framework?. The conclusion considers the implications
        for practitioners and policy-makers, and outlines an agenda for further research.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        path-tracking controller is presented for automating the reversing of multiplyarticulated
        vehicles. This uses a state feedback approach and steers the wheels of the
        front axle to ensure the rearmost vehicle unit tracks a specified path. Linear
        closed-loop analysis is performed and shows that the controller is stable
        for vehicles with up to six trailers. The controller is implemented on three
        full-size, experimental heavy vehicles: a ?Tractor-Semitrailer?, ?B-double?
        and ?B-triple? which have one, two and three trailers respectively. Experimental
        results are presented and the controller performance is evaluated. All test
        vehicles were able to track paths to within 400mm of the desired path.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        cell cycle checkpoint kinase inhibitors with the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic
        agent gemcitabine offers clinical appeal, with a mechanistic rationale based
        chiefly on abrogation of gemcitabine-induced G2/M checkpoint activation. However,
        evidence supporting this mechanistic rationale from chemosensitization studies
        has not been consistent. Here we report a systematic definition of how pancreatic
        cancer cells harboring mutant p53 respond to this combination therapy, by
        combining mathematical models with large-scale quantitative biological analyses
        of single cells and cell populations. Notably, we uncovered a dynamic range
        of mechanistic effects at different ratios of gemcitabine and CHK1 inhibitors.
        Remarkably, effective synergy was attained even where cells exhibited an apparently
        functional G2/M surveillance mechanism, as exemplified by a lack of both overt
        premature CDK1 activation and S-phase mitotic entry. Consistent with these
        findings, S/G2 duration was extended in treated cells, leading to an definable
        set of lineage-dependent catastrophic fates. At synergistic drug concentrations,
        global replication stress was a distinct indicator of chemosensitization as
        characterized molecularly by an accumulation of S-phase cells with high levels
        of hyperphosphorylated, RPA-loaded single-stranded DNA. In a fraction of these
        cells, persistent genomic damage was observed, including chromosomal fragmentation
        with a loss of centromeric regions that prevented proper kinetochore-microtubule
        attachment. Together, our results suggested a \"foot-in-thedoor\" mechanism
        for drug synergy where cells were destroyed not by frank G2/M phase abrogation,
        but rather by initiating a cumulative genotoxicity that deregulated DNA synthesis.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This

        numerical simulation of freely-propagating premixed flames of a multicomponent
        fuel is performed using a skeletal chemical mechanism with 49 reactions and
        15 species. The fuel consists of CO,H2,H2O,CH4 and CO2 in proportions akin
        to blast furnace gas or a low calorific value syngas. The simulations include
        low and high turbulence levels to elucidate the effect of turbulence on realistic
        chemistry flames. The multi-component fuel flame is found to have a more complex
        structure than most common flames, with individual species reaction zones
        not necessarily overlapping with each other and with a wide heat releasing
        zone. The species mass fractions and heat release rate show significant scatter,
        with their conditional average however remaining close to the laminar flame
        result. Probability density functions of displacement speed, stretch rate,
        and curvature are near-Gaussian. Five different mean reaction rate closures
        are evaluated in the RANS context using these DNS data, presenting perhaps
        the most stringent test to date of the combustion models. Significant quantitative
        differences are observed in the performance of the models tested, especially
        for the higher turbulence level case.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>ZMN

        quasi-isotropic CFRP laminate, containing a notch or circular hole, is subjected
        to combined tension and shear, or compression. The measured failure strengths
        of the specimens are used to construct failure envelopes in stress space.
        Three competing failure mechanisms are observed, and for each mechanism splitting
        within the critical ply reduces the stress concentration from the hole or
        notch: (i) a tension-dominated mode, with laminate failure dictated by tensile
        failure of the 0? plies, (ii) a shear-dominated mode entailing microbuckling
        of the -45? plies, and (iii) microbuckling of the 0? plies under remote compression.
        The net section strength (for all stress states investigated) is greater for
        specimens with a notch than a circular hole, and this is associated with greater
        split development in the load-bearing plies. The paper contributes to the
        literature by reporting sub-critical damage modes and failure envelopes under
        multi-axial loading for two types of stress raiser.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Financial

        the most abundant proteins in mammals, are defined by their triple-helical
        structures and distinctive Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeating sequence, where Xaa is often
        proline and Yaa, hydroxyproline (Hyp/O). It is known that hydroxyproline in
        the Yaa position stabilises the triple helix, and that lack of proline hydroxylation
        in vivo leads to dysfunctional collagen extracellular matrix assembly, due
        to a range of factors such as a change in hydration properties. In addition,
        we note that in model peptides, when Yaa is unmodified proline, the Xaa proline
        has a strong propensity to adopt an endo ring conformation, whilst when Yaa
        is hydroxyproline, the Xaa proline adopts a range of endo and exo conformations.
        Here we use a combination of solid-state NMR spectroscopy and potential energy
        landscape modelling of synthetic triple-helical collagen peptides to understand
        this effect. We show that hydroxylation of the Yaa proline causes the Xaa
        proline ring conformation to become metastable, which in turn confers flexibility
        on the triple helix.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The authors acknowledge

        populism and technocracy increasingly appear as the two organising poles of
        politics in contemporary Western democracies, the exact nature of their relationship
        has not been the focus of systematic attention. This article argues that whilst
        these two terms ? and the political realities they refer to ? are usually
        assumed to be irreducibly opposed to one another, there is also an important
        element of complementarity between them. This complementarity consists in
        the fact that both populism and technocracy are predicated upon an implicit
        critique of a specific political form, referred to in this article as ?party
        democracy?. This is defined as a political regime based on two key features:
        the mediation of political conflicts through the institution of political
        parties and a procedural conception of political legitimacy according to which
        political outcomes are legitimate to the extent that they are the product
        of a set of democratic procedures revolving around the principles of parliamentary
        deliberation and electoral competition. This argument is made through a close
        analysis of works by Ernesto Laclau and Pierre Rosanvallon, chosen as exemplary
        manifestations of the contemporary cases for populism and technocracy, respectively.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-07-03T10:49:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-07-03T10:49:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-04-07</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:type>accepted

        each sex, there is an association between hip fracture risk and the size of
        the proximal femur, with larger femurs apparently more susceptible to fracture.
        Here, we investigate whether the thickness and density of the femoral cortex
        play a role in this association: might larger femurs harbour focal, cortical
        defects? To answer this question, we used cortical bone mapping to measure
        the distribution of cortical mass surface density (CMSD, mg/cm^2) in cohorts
        of 308 males and 125 females. Principal component analysis of the various
        femoral surfaces led to a measure of size that is &#13;\nlinearly independent
        from shape. After mapping the data onto a canonical femur surface, we used
        statistical parametric mapping to identify any regions where CMSD depends
        on size, allowing for other confounding covariates including shape. Our principal
        finding was a focal patch on the superior femoral neck, where CMSD is reduced
        by around 1% for each 1% increase in proximal-distal size (p &lt; 0:000005
        in the males, p &lt; 0:001 in the females). This finding appears to be consistent
        with models of functional adaptation, and may help with the design of interventional
        strategies for reducing fracture risk.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>KESP

        kinetic modelling using dynamic PET requires knowledge of the tracer concentration
        in plasma, known as the arterial input function (AIF). AIFs are usually determined
        by invasive blood sampling, but this is prohibitive in murine studies due
        to low total blood volumes. As a result of the low spatial resolution of PET,
        image-derived input functions (IDIFs) must be extracted from left ventricular
        blood pool (LVBP) ROIs of the mouse heart. This is challenging because of
        partial volume and spillover effects between the LVBP and myocardium, contaminating
        IDIFs with tissue signal. We have applied the geometric transfer matrix (GTM)
        method of partial volume correction (PVC) to 12 mice injected with ^{18}{\\rm
        F} - {\\rm FDG} affected by a Myocardial Infarction (MI), of which 6 were
        treated with a drug which reduced infarction size . We utilised high resolution
        MRI to assist in segmenting mouse hearts into 5 classes: LVBP, infarcted myocardium,
        healthy myocardium, lungs/body and background. The signal contribution from
        these 5 classes was convolved with the point spread function (PSF) of the
        Cambridge split magnet PET scanner and a non-linear fit was performed on the
        5 measured signal components. The corrected IDIF was taken as the fitted LVBP
        component. It was found that the GTM PVC method could recover an IDIF with
        less contamination from spillover than an IDIF extracted from PET data alone.
        More realistic values of {{\\rm K}_{\\rm i}} were achieved using GTM IDIFs,
        which were shown to be significantly different ( {\\rm p} &lt; 0.05 ) between
        the treated and untreated groups.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>E. Evans

        NEWMEDS initiative (Novel Methods leading to New Medications in Depression
        and Schizophrenia, http://www.newmeds-europe.com) is a large industrial-academic
        collaborative project aimed at developing new methods for drug discovery for
        schizophrenia. As part of this project, Work package 2 (WP02) has developed
        and validated a comprehensive battery of novel touchscreen tasks for rats
        and mice for assessing cognitive domains relevant to schizophrenia. &#13;\n&#13;\nObjectives&#13;\nThis
        article provides a review of the touchscreen battery of tasks for rats and
        mice for assessing cognitive domains relevant to schizophrenia and highlights
        validation data presented in several primary articles in this issue and elsewhere.&#13;\n&#13;\nMethods
        &#13;\nThe battery consists of the 5-choice serial reaction time task and
        a novel rodent continuous performance task for measuring attention, a 3-stimulus
        visual reversal and the serial visual reversal task for measuring cognitive
        flexibility, novel nonmatching-to-sample based tasks for measuring spatial
        working memory and paired-associates learning for measuring long term memory.&#13;\n&#13;\nResults&#13;\nThe
        rodent (i.e. both rats and mice) touchscreen operant chamber and battery has
        high translational value across species due to its emphasis on construct as
        well as face validity. In addition, it offers cognitive profiling of models
        of diseases with cognitive symptoms (not limited to schizophrenia) through
        a battery approach, whereby multiple cognitive constructs can be measured
        using the same apparatus, enabling comparisons of performance across tasks.&#13;\n&#13;\nConclusion&#13;\nThis
        battery of tests constitutes an extensive tool package for both model characterisation
        and preclinical drug discovery.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This work

        is the final version of the article. It first appeared from Oxford University
        Press via http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ijnp/pyv074</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Background:
        The ability to wait and to weigh evidence is critical to behavioural regulation.
        These behaviors are known as waiting and reflection impulsivity. In Study
        1, we examined the effects of methylphenidate (MPH), a dopamine and norepinephrine
        reuptake inhibitor, on waiting and reflection impulsivity in healthy young
        individuals. In Study 2, we assessed the role of learning from feedback in
        disorders of addiction.&#13;\n&#13;\nMethods: We used the recently developed
        4-Choice Serial Reaction Time task and the Beads task. Twenty-eight healthy
        volunteers were tested twice in a randomized double-blind placebo controlled
        cross-over trial with 20mg MPH. In the second study we analyzed premature
        responses as a function of prior feedback in disorders of addiction.&#13;\n&#13;\nResults:
        Study 1: MPH was associated with greater waiting impulsivity to a cue predicting
        reward along with faster responding to target onset without a generalized
        effect on reaction time or attention. MPH influenced reflection impulsivity
        based on baseline impulsivity. Study 2: more premature responses occurred
        after premature responses in stimulant dependent subjects.&#13;\n&#13;\nConclusions:
        We show that MPH has dissociable effects on waiting and reflection impulsivity.
        Chronic stimulant exposure impairs learning from prior premature responses
        suggesting a failure to learn that premature responding is suboptimal. These
        findings provide a greater mechanistic understanding of waiting impulsivity.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>VV

        study reports the findings of an experimental investigation into the behaviour
        of an inclined shear plane in reinforced concrete, such as a diagonal crack
        in the web of a beam, strengthened with externally bonded Carbon Fibre Reinforced
        Polymer (CFRP) fabric. A modified push-off test of novel geometry was developed
        for this study. This test generates a diagonal failure plane subject to combined
        shear and tension. Both unwrapped and wrapped tests were conducted, allowing
        the load sharing and load displacement behaviour of the reinforced concrete,
        and the reinforced concrete with externally bonded CFRP fabric, to be investigated.
        Fully wrapped and U-wrapped CFRP fabric configurations were tested. Results
        indicate that for the arrangement tested, concrete, steel and CFRP contributions
        to resistance are not independent, and that effective anchorage lengths given
        in the UK and US guidance for U-wrapped CFRP may not be adequate in some cases.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The
