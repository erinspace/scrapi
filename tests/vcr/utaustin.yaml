        arguing for the persona poem as a viable tradition in American literature,
        Elizabeth Frye reconstructs a lineage of dramatic poetry that spans the entire
        twentieth century. Through comparative studies of canonical poets predominately
        working in the aftermath of high modernism, she examines several significant
        performances and contends that the genre persists as a site of necessary and
        complicated cross-identifications. Chapter One elucidates the profound connection
        between Langston Hughes\u2019s and Gwendolyn Brooks\u2019s use of the persona
        poem and the Great Migration. Frye understands the blues-inflected utterances
        of Hughes\u2019s collection Fine Clothes to the Jew as deeply invested in
        formal itinerancy and geographic indeterminacy. Similarly, she suggests that
        Brooks\u2019s dramatic projections of American soldiers in the aftermath of
        World War II betray the poets\u2019 dual obsessions with large-scale migration
        and polyvocality. Chapter Two continues to treat the persona poem as a socially
        invested phenomenon. Frye reads the gendered vulnerability in scenes of nascent
        national development in John Berryman\u2019s \u201CHomage to Mistress Bradstreet\u201D
        and Robert Hayden\u2019s \u201CA Letter from Phillis Wheatley\u201D as a response
        to the horrors of World War II and the transatlantic slave trade. Chapter
        Three scrutinizes the \u201Cconfessional\u201D paradigm by revisiting the
        other voices and other selves that recurrently interrupt Robert Lowell\u2019s
        Life Studies and Sylvia Plath\u2019s Ariel. By insisting on the importance
        of dramatic poetry in these collections, Frye further complicates the frequently
        invoked conflict between impersonality and personality. Finally, a coda recognizes
        the work of Natasha Trethewey and Elizabeth Alexander as indicative of the
        contemporary gravitation toward the persona poem. She positions Trethewey
        and Alexander as the heirs to several poets whose poems are discussed in this
        study. In detecting a sense of bereavement in these poets\u2019 willfully
        incomplete projects of recovery, Frye proposes that the persona poem is not
        only a powerful tool of historical engagement, but a means of critically examining
        the limits of both literary community and communion with the past.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>English</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T15:26:46Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T15:26:46Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        is emerging, in the discipline of rhetoric and composition, a rhetoric of
        food. In this dissertation, I map the various approaches to food rhetorics,
        and I look at three different foods: burritos, kale, and kombucha. Using these
        foods as commonplaces, I explore the social and rhetorical discourse around
        them. I use \u201Ca cultural biography of things\u201D methodology to describe
        the history of the burrito and use that history to contextualize Chipotle
        Mexican Grill\u2019s new media strategies. Throughout the cultural biography
        of the burrito and the analysis of Chipotle\u2019s marketing, I highlight
        a theatrical mimesis that blurs the lines between imitation and reality. I
        suggest that kale can be associated the books of Michael Pollan, whose work,
        I argue, constitutes a genre that establishes a set of conventions for how
        we think and communicate about food. I begin by looking at how Chipotle builds
        its corporate ethos by citing Michael Pollan\u2019s books on its website.
        Then I approach Pollan\u2019s body of work as a genre, showing how it establishes
        certain conventions in food discourse. We see transmissions of these conventions
        throughout food networks. I look at how fermented foods, like kombucha, travel
        through alternative food networks, like groups of \u201Cfermentos\u201D led
        by Sandor Katz, until they have proliferated to the point of becoming mainstream.
        I show how Michael Pollan engages with the world of countercultural food movements
        like fermentos and argue that Pollan\u2019s engagement with fermentos signals
        a move into posthuman rhetorics. Building on the idea of micropolitics, I
        posit a compostmodern micro(be)politics that re-articulates the human not
        as an agentive individual governed by autonomy, but as an ecology itself,
        situated within other ecologies. I conclude by reading \u201Cnobody cares
        what you ate for lunch\u201D memes as a response to and provocation to an
        abundance of online food talk. We can read these memes as evidence of the
        significance of online food discourse. Instead of taking the memes at face
        value, we can ask, \u201Cwho does care about food in online networks?\u201D</dc:description>\n<dc:description>English</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T15:35:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T15:35:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05-04</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        dissertation critically examines representations of the jury in Victorian
        novels.  I argue that studying the jury, as a concept and in practice, offers
        a unique window to both the social and literary vision of Victorian novelists.
        \ The second half of the nineteenth century saw a decline in the use and cultural
        perception of the jury, and the controversy surrounding the jury\u2019s competency
        to administer justice implicated broad social questions of education and class
        that shaped the formation of British identity.  The Victorian debate over
        the future of the jury was a public conversation occurring in legal treatises,
        the press, and in literature.  By engaging in the debate over the future of
        the institution of the jury, Victorian novelists forge their own \u201Cjuryman\u2019s
        guidebook\u201D to educate the readers, the potential jurors of England.  In
        addition to social questions, I examine how the novel uses features of the
        jury\u2014the jury\u2019s role as a \u201Cfinder of fact\u201D and the jury\u2019s
        narrative silence\u2014as narrative techniques.  Novelists explore the jury\u2019s
        role as a \u201Cfinder of fact\u201D while negotiating their own role as \u201Cfinder
        of fact\u201D by balancing legal realism with legal imagination in fictional
        legal narratives.  Additionally, examining the jury\u2019s narrative silence
        is essential to understanding each author\u2019s legal imagination.  By analyzing
        the narrative techniques and descriptive strategies surrounding the jury in
        the works of Anthony Trollope, Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, M.E. Braddon
        and Henry Rider Haggard, this project demonstrates how the Victorian cultural
        anxiety over the future of the jury is captured in literature across genres.
        \ The responses of these authors to the jury debate range from ambivalence
        to concrete visions for legal reform; however, each of these authors, through
        serious engagement with a legal controversy, writes the law.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>English</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T15:44:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T15:44:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05-12</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        has long been neglected by writing-in-the-disciplines (WID) scholars in favor
        of science and business writing. Disciplining the Muse argues that there is
        much for WID scholars to learn by investigating non-traditional fields that
        make claims for disciplinarity; additionally, emerging and contested disciplines
        offer insight into the nature of disciplinarity itself. My work bridges WID
        issues of disciplinary definition and development by looking at one extreme
        case within English Studies: creative writing studies (CWS). CWS rhetorically
        disidentifies with literature, composition and traditional creative writing
        while inspiring cohesion within their own field. Complicating this project,
        long-held ambivalence towards disciplinarity within creative writing creates
        a riff between the vanguard and many practitioners.  The CWS vanguard declares
        disciplinary criteria of research, pedagogy and institutional sanction in
        order to bolster their claims. Instead of using outsider definitions of disciplinarity,
        in this dissertation I employ qualitative and quantitative research methods
        to evaluate the gap between the vanguard\u2019s disciplinary claims and practices.
        The material and cultural implications of being a discipline can be high,
        and WID scholars should seek for the insider view for new disciplines\u2014how
        well developing disciplines live up to their own stated standards and aspirations.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>English</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T16:00:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T16:00:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-14</dc:date>\n<dc:date>August

        scholars have argued that Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet was modeled after two
        earlier plays by Thomas Kyd\u2014the so-called Ur-Hamlet and The Spanish Tragedy\u2014this
        dissertation finds a middle step in this trajectory of influence: the systematic
        character revision of the role of Hieronimo in the 320 anonymous lines added
        to the 1602 Spanish Tragedy quarto. The increasingly persuasive arguments
        for Shakespeare\u2019s hand in these Additions offer an opportunity to explore
        the implications of this specific emendation, which is represented here as
        a small-scale exercise for Shakespeare and Richard Burbage to attempt and
        rehearse more modern, philosophical personations of grief and madness before
        their great undertaking of Hamlet. This dissertation reads the Shakespearean
        Additions to The Spanish Tragedy alongside Hamlet to trace Shakespeare\u2019s
        developing style and to demonstrate how the Additions may be seen as Hamlet\u2019s
        verbal and thematic precursor. In its introduction and six chapters, this
        project provides several reinterpretations of primary records relevant to
        Shakespeare\u2019s theatrical career in a roughly chronological narrative

        dissertation analyzes English Renaissance representations of penitential experience:
        the emotions of guilt, shame, remorse, and regret, and the practices by which
        people respond to those emotions. I consider penitential episodes in Philip
        Sidney\u2019s Arcadia (1590), Edmund Spenser\u2019s The Faerie Queene (1590
        and 1596), and William Shakespeare\u2019s The Winter\u2019s Tale (1611) alongside
        works of practical divinity that popularized Protestant penitential doctrines
        for lay readers, including sermons, treatises, and devotional handbooks. Penitence
        is traditionally understood as a means to an end: divine forgiveness, renewal
        as a better self, or reconciliation with those we have harmed. But my dissertation
        highlights episodes of frustrated, failed, and endless penitence, in which
        characters feel genuine remorse for their past wrongdoing and struggle to
        make amends for it but fear that their efforts can never be sufficient to
        reach the endpoints they seek. The romance texts in my study reveal the emotional
        strain and uncertainty wrought by the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation,
        which radically altered traditional approaches to penitence. Reformers redefined
        penitence not as satisfaction for the debt of sin, but as a radical self-transformation
        that only God could initiate. Historians have long recognized this shift as
        a crucial center of controversy in the period, but critics have only recently
        begun to consider how imaginative literature responded to it. I demonstrate
        that Sidney, Spenser and Shakespeare confront the painful emotional consequences
        of Protestant doctrine and imagine alternative, more livable forms of penitence
        for secular life. They do so in part by staging penitential narratives in
        fictive pagan settings, where characters must confront their guilt without
        the aid of Christian ritual structures and consolations. Against the grain
        of a culture that valued divine salvation above all else and shifted responsibility
        for that salvation into the hands of an unknowable God, these authors restore
        attention to the practical and social dimensions of penitence as a lived experience
        within this world.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>English</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T16:14:28Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T16:14:28Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08-13</dc:date>\n<dc:date>August

        first study the effects of additional loan modifications on loan losses during
        the recent financial crisis. Despite loan modification being widely discussed
        as an alternative to foreclosure, little research has focused on quantifying
        its effect on loan performance. By exploiting plausible exogenous variation
        in the incentives to modify securitized non-agency loans, I find that an additional
        modification reduces loan losses by 34.5% relative to the average loss. Consistent
        with theory, modifications are especially beneficial when borrowers are less
        likely to return to a current status without help and when foreclosure losses
        are higher. Modification types that grant greater concessions to borrowers
        are the most effective for minimizing losses. Overall, additional modifications
        prevent borrower foreclosure while simultaneously benefiting investors. I
        then study the relation between originators that misreported mortgages and
        house price movements. ZIP codes with high concentrations of misreporting
        originators experienced a 75% larger relative increase in house prices from
        2003 to 2006 and a 90% larger relative decrease from 2007 to 2012 compared
        to other ZIPs. Six causality related tests suggest that high fractions of
        bad originators in a ZIP result in larger price swings. In areas of elastic
        land supply, ZIPs with bad originators are associated with a building boom
        and a subsequent price bust that is much more severe than in similar ZIPs
        without bad originators. Originators with high misreporting seemed to have
        both given credit to borrowers of a higher stated risk and further understated
        the borrowers' true risk. Overall, the findings suggest that there are settings
        where questionable business practices can lead to large distortionary effects.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Finance</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T16:20:24Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T16:20:24Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05-01</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        timing</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In Chapter 1, I provide new compelling
        evidence that hedge funds possess investment skill. Using the longest-in-literature
        hedge fund sample with fewer biases, I show that large holdings of past winners
        earn 7% annual benchmark-adjusted return. This remarkable performance is consistent
        with the notion that large holdings represent managers' best ideas.  My sample
        goes back to 1980 and does not miss non-surviving hedge funds, or those that
        do not voluntarily report to commercial databases.  It consists of all investment
        managers that must report to the SEC, except those that I identify as managers
        other than hedge funds.  While publicly available data is not sufficient to
        identify hedge funds directly, my \"reverse identification\" method achieves
        both high sensitivity and specificity. I also find weaker yet significant
        evidence of investment skill in standard indicators such as average fund performance
        and performance persistence. Additionally, I study the announcement effect
        of 13F holdings disclosure on the disclosed stock return and trading volume.
        In Chapter 2, I provide new evidence on market timing by studying ETF option
        holdings of hedge funds. I find that market option holdings are economically
        significant in terms of their impact on the market exposure of the funds.
        Further, I find significant time variation in market option holdings, which
        could be due to market timing activity. I find that market option holdings
        are associated with such fund characteristics as active share and market exposure
        of the fund due to its stock holdings; this evidence is consistent with options
        being used for hedging. Increases in aggregate hedge fund industry holdings
        of market put options predict low market returns. In the cross-section of
        hedge funds, the top 5% group has market volatility timing skill that is distinguished
        from luck with a bootstrapping test. Additionally, I measure market timing
        ability as the average risk-adjusted return on market option holdings, which,
        due to data limitations, requires additional assumptions about option prices.
        I find that this market timing ability is close to zero for the average fund
        but it is negative for heavy option users.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Finance</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T16:32:11Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T16:32:11Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08-14</dc:date>\n<dc:date>August

        language</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Despite the growing recognition of
        the reading-writing connection both in first language and second/foreign language
        acquisition, few studies have empirically investigated whether reading improves
        writing, or vice versa. Taking a step further from the existing correlation
        studies, the current experimental study examined the effects of extensive
        reading, extensive writing, and regular instruction (serving as a control)
        on reading comprehension, writing performance, knowledge of grammar, and attitudes
        of Korean middle school students learning English as a foreign language. Randomly
        assigned to one of three instructional types, the participants (N = 306) received
        treatment instruction, once a week for two semesters, as part of their English
        curricula. At the beginning and end of the treatment, the study administered
        language measures of reading, writing, and grammar as well as attitude questionnaires
        toward their treatment and toward reading and writing in English. Results
        indicated that both extensive reading and extensive writing had positive effects
        on the development of reading comprehension, writing performance, and grammar
        knowledge. The results reveal particular support for the reading-writing connections.
        For example, the extensive-reading group, but not the control group, made
        significant gains in writing, though neither group engaged in writing practice
        in English. The extensive-writing group, moreover, improved significantly
        in reading comprehension despite only practicing writing. Also, the contributions
        of treatment instruction to knowledge of grammar did not significantly differ
        among the three groups. Nevertheless, exploratory post hoc analyses suggest
        that extensive reading may have a more positive impact on general grammar,
        articles, and prepositions. In terms of students\u2019 attitudes, the extensive-writing
        group did not indicate their willingness to continue to write, despite the
        significantly higher levels of enjoyment and engagement in the activity. In
        contrast, the extensive-reading group revealed a significantly stronger willingness
        to sustain reading books as well as a significant decrease in reading apprehension,
        particularly among students at the lowest proficiency level. The predominant
        status of reading over writing in English curricula as well as exams seems
        to influence students\u2019 attitudes toward reading and writing. Findings
        are used to propose theoretical, practical, and pedagogical implications.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Foreign

        dissertation investigates the language used in contemporary Italian cinema,
        with particular focus on popular comedy through the analysis of ten films
        released in a 30-year span period, from 1980 to 2010. My work argues that
        comedy dialogues may serve linguistic descriptive purposes since they use
        the complete spectrum of contemporary trends. The project analyzes how cinema
        uses common language and how film dialogues record linguistic changes in Italian,
        proving to be a useful and powerful medium for describing contemporary language.
        A subsequent question that my work addresses is how comedy\u2019s film dialogues
        represent a changing society. A detailed analysis of the four linguistic levels:
        phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon is conducted in the dialogues of
        the films selected. Through the observation of the occurrences of the new
        linguistic tendencies I establish which variables trigger their use, what
        are the differences among the characters\u2019 speeches, and whether and how
        the language used differs from standard language. Also, the comparison with
        contemporary Italian reveals the degree of sociolinguistic reliability of
        the dialogue of popular comedy. A further type of comparison is the one between
        the written screenplays and the final version of the films, which reveals
        some of the linguistic dynamics behind the trajectory from a written to a
        spoken version of the text. The data I collected show an overall reliable
        reproduction by most films of the new linguistic trends, and a reliable representation
        of the sociolinguistic complexity of contemporary Italian. This attempt to
        imitate reality shows, in my opinion, the scarce inclination to linguistic
        experimentalism of Italian comedy. On the other hand, what film dialogues
        fail to reflect in a realistic way are the traits intrinsically related to
        oral discourse such as interruptions, reformulations, and drawbacks. What
        my work ultimately highlights is the value of the close analysis of film dialogues
        as an interdisciplinary method that can contribute to linguistic accounts

        use of French in code-switching (CS) with Moroccan Colloquial Arabic (MCA)
        has been explored qualitatively in a number of studies, but quantitative methods
        have rarely been applied to CS in this language pair. Research on CS patterns
        as a function of extra-linguistic factors has similarly received little attention,
        despite the implication in many studies that these factors are significant
        in the use of CS. This dissertation seeks to address these gaps in the literature
        by quantitatively examining the use of Arabic-French CS by young adult speakers
        of MCA in spoken and written information communication. This study examines
        three extra-linguistic factors in speech and Instant Messaging (IM): Sex,
        French Proficiency, and Language Attitude. The analysis reveals that male
        speakers are significantly more French in written IM. Positive attitude toward
        French and MCA-French CS has a highly significant impact on the rate of French
        employed in spoken conversation. Meaningful results are also found for the
        French constituents employed in CS with regard to each of the extra-linguistic
        factors. Notable differences are found between sexes in the types of French
        constituents used in both communication modes, as well as for speakers of
        different French proficiency levels. The categorization of French-origin nouns
        as instances of CS or borrowing is also explored by considering multiple aspects
        of use of these lexical items. A number of French-origin nouns, absent from
        dictionaries of MCA, are proposed to now be borrowed into the dialect. The
        analysis also reveals a number of French-origin words that are used by a number
        of speakers, but remain instances of CS. The results of this investigation
        highlight the importance of quantification in studies of CS and provide data
        for comparison with other corpora from this and other language pairs. The
        differences identified in CS by communication mode indicate that there is
        a need for a model of written CS that accounts for the unique characteristics
        of this mode. Finally, little work has been published on the relationship
        between extra-linguistic factors and structural patterns in CS, but the current
        results suggest that the impact of social factors should not be ignored when
        considering structural aspects of CS.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>French

        dissertation explores the language attitudes (LAs) of second-generation North
        African immigrants in France toward Arabic and French, focusing primarily
        on women. I explore how these attitudes are correlated with religiosity, national
        identity and proficiency. Although numerous LA studies have been done in the
        Maghreb, none have examined the attitudes of the highly marginalized North
        African community in France. Previous research in LAs and in sociolinguistics
        has also neglected religion as a variable, a gap in the literature that this
        dissertation addresses. French and Arabic have powerful language ideologies
        making them an ideal language pairing to study. Muslims believe Arabic is
        the only language through which the true message of the Qur\u2019an can be
        transmitted (Suleiman, 2003). Previous LA studies in the Maghreb indicate
        that people there strongly associate Islam with Arabic (Benrabah 2007; Chakrani,
        2010). It is also the national language of most Muslim majority countries
        and is linked with both national and pan-Arab identity (Dawisha, 2003). The
        French language is seen as the vehicle of French culture and is an important
        symbol of national identity that is used as a tool for the assimilation of
        immigrants (Weil, 2010). There is evidence to suggest that LAs are stronger
        in a diaspora context (Garrett, Bishop &amp; Coupland, 2009). Language attitudes
        may be especially potent for the North African diaspora because of the colonial
        history between France and the Maghreb, and the strained relationship between
        France and its immigrant population. Given that language can act as a symbol
        of culture (Choi, 2003), participants who more closely identify with their
        North African cultural and religious heritage will express more positive attitudes
        toward Arabic. In order to explore these topics, I constructed an anonymous
        language attitudes survey that was distributed online to second-generation
        North Africans in France, ages 18 to 30. The survey included questions concerning
        attitudes toward religious and national identity. The results indicate positive
        attitudes toward Arabic, Islam and North Africa, while expressing relatively
        neutral attitudes toward French, and negative attitudes toward France. Correlations
        did emerge that suggest a relationship between religiosity, national identity,
        and language attitudes for this population.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>French

        Latin American migrants arriving to Buenos Aires are usually able to find
        work and access urban resources, but struggle to secure stable housing inside
        the city.  Faced with this dilemma, they often scramble to find somewhere
        to live among the city\u2019s informal housing options.  Some move into casas
        tomadas, crowded, run-down boarding houses and informal hotels where multiple
        families live together. Inside, residents must constantly negotiate their
        presence and their access to shared spaces and amenities, all the while waiting
        to be evicted.  In Argentina, the eviction process can take anywhere from
        a few months to a few years as the case makes its way through the courts.
        Despite the tenuous conditions, residents benefit from these spaces, which
        are often centrally located, close to jobs, schools and public transportation.
        Using a multi-scale, ethnographic approach, this dissertation explores how
        residents of casas tomadas cope with housing instability and struggle to stay
        in the city amidst the threat of eviction. Focus is on residents\u2019 routine
        practices inside casas tomadas, their alliances with housing organizations,
        and their reliance on the city government housing subsidy.  My findings show
        that structural and temporal conditions at these different scales limit and
        destabilize residents and advocates\u2019 struggle for housing and the right
        to the city.  Building upon literature on the right to the city, critical
        urban studies and political ecology, this dissertation seeks to broaden and
        deepen our understanding of the routine and everyday ways the poor experience
        urban instability and marginalization. In this research housing and home are
        understood as a primary resource from which people can access other important
        urban resources. As such, this dissertation argues that house and home are
        a fundamental and central element in any struggle for the right to the city.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Geography

        dissertation investigates payment for environmental services (PES) programs
        on the Osa peninsula in southwestern Costa Rica. Three aspects of life in
        Osa Costa Rica are found to critically affect PES implementation: the unique
        geographical and cultural setting of Osa, a history of murky land tenure in
        the region, and the often underemphasized role of women. Osa\u2019s mountainous
        forested terrain makes enforcement of logging bans very difficult without
        the help of in-situ \u201Cguardaparques\u201D(forest rangers) in the form
        of PES-participating landowners themselves. However, the agency in charge
        of enforcing environmental protection (MINAE) is indispensable, despite its
        bouts with corruption and abuse of power. Broadly, though specific flaws in
        the PES program are identified herein, the program is, nonetheless, found
        to be a beneficial and core part of the ideological and financial evolution
        of the region. The related issue of nebulous land tenure in the region began
        in the 1960s and 70s when squatters were encouraged to settle and develop
        land on the peninsula. A stark shift came with the passage of National Forestry
        Law 7575 of 1996 which claimed all non-privately-owned forest for the state
        of Costa Rica, essentially ceasing the process of granting formal land title
        to squatters. This thrust hundreds of squatters into a state of legal and
        financial limbo, affecting their ability both to participate in PES and to
        sell their land. Gender is also central to this investigation as only approximately
        ten percent of PES-participating properties in the Osa region are owned by
        women (nearly twenty percent if married couples are included), yet a greater
        prevalence of pro-environment and pro-conservation attitudes is exhibited
        by women in interviews than by men. For instance, women more often mention
        \u201Cmore time with family\u201D and \u201Chelping the environment\u201D
        compared to men when asked what are their personal benefits of PES participation.
        Also, a much larger percentage of women than men see protecting the environment
        as the responsibility of the landowner.  The concluding chapter lauds the
        philosophical foundation and the overall potential of payment for environmental
        services and also proffers several recommendations as remedies for specific
        foibles of the PES system.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Geography and

        occurs when a word or phrase is used in a way that conflicts with its usual
        (literal) meaning, so that part of its meaning is applied to a different semantic
        domain. For example, time is construed as money in \u201CThis gadget will
        save you hours\u201D (Lakoff and Johnson 1980). There is a link between the
        concepts time and money that underlies many expressions in English; this is
        therefore considered a conceptual metaphor. Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT)
        has dominated metaphor research since Lakoff and Johnson (1980), but researchers
        (e.g. Croft 2009, Sullivan 2013) are turning to other cognitive linguistic
        theories such as Frame Semantics (Fillmore 1982) and Cognitive Grammar (Langacker
        1987) to rectify the problems inherent in that approach. CMT does not provide
        tools for systematically defining metaphoric concepts and their components,
        which prevents the analysis of metaphor\u2019s internal meaning. It views
        metaphor as a superimposition of meaning from one domain (e.g. money above)
        onto another (e.g. time). Corpus data has improved metaphor research methods,
        but sounder methodology is needed to choose which metaphors to study. This
        dissertation takes a novel approach to metaphor in that the data are taken
        from a semantically annotated corpus where their semantic domains are already
        assigned. The main dataset is comprised of a naturally occurring group of
        related metaphors that construe awareness as perception. Using the notion
        of frame from Frame Semantics (Fillmore 1982) as implemented in the lexicographic
        database FrameNet (Atkins et al. 2003) to define semantic domains and their
        internal components (frame elements; similar to semantic roles), this dissertation
        analyzes metaphors from the frame-semantically annotated database of German,
        SALSA (Burchardt et al. 2006, 2009), to investigate how meaning elements (semantic
        roles) from the metaphor\u2019s two semantic domains align. I show that semantic
        roles align consistently, although not every semantic role has a counterpart
        in the other domain. I argue that the use of semantic and syntactic information
        that is associated with one domain but not the other allows emergent meaning
        to be created in metaphor. The analysis supports the view of metaphor as a
        blended space, independent of either semantic domain, as described by Fauconnier
        and Turner (2002).</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Germanic Studies</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T17:33:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T17:33:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05-04</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        study examines how Europeanist ethnologists (Volkskundler / Europ\xE4ische
        Ethnologen) in Germany (East, West, and reunified) have reconstructed their
        discipline\u2019s history from the end of World War II to the present. In
        this treatment, historiography is understood not simply as a discourse, but
        as a narrative performance by and for parties invested in the discipline.
        These performances, it will be shown, have real implications for the field\u2019s
        organizational and epistemic structuring, and vice versa\u2014a symbiosis
        referred to here as \u201Cinstitutional memory.\u201D The project\u2019s goal
        is not to produce another history of the discipline, but rather to trace how
        institutional memory is rewritten or translated (in Andr\xE9 Lefevere\u2019s
        sense) across historical ruptures and in conversation with other social fields
        (in Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s sense). By mapping the disciplinary identities
        performed by the field\u2019s authorized parties in monographs, articles,
        programmatic statements, and interviews conducted with three generations of
        Volkskundler / Europ\xE4ische Ethnologen, the analysis reveals to what extent
        the field\u2019s institutional memory aligns with postwar Germany\u2019s ongoing
        struggle to connect its past with its current national and global identities.
        Part I considers how the trope of Vergangenheitsbew\xE4ltigung (overcoming
        the past) came to dominate institutional memory in West German and post-reunification
        Volkskunde / Europ\xE4ische Ethnologie. Parts II and III then consider latent
        and emergent boundary issues that had been eclipsed by the long shadow of
        the National Socialist past. Part II examines the dynamics of East German
        Volkskunde\u2019s institutional memory and the challenge of gathering the
        two national traditions into a unified institutional memory after national
        reunification in 1989/90. Part III considers patterns of interdisciplinary
        and international boundary-crossing and -reinforcement shown to be both latent
        across the field\u2019s postwar institutional memory and emergent as the field
        continues to translate its identity in confronting new external pressures.
        By considering narrative performances of boundary problems as sites of institutional
        memory in their own right, the final analysis reveals how the preoccupation
        with the effects of the Nazi era is in fact only one of several possible,
        concurrent translations of a centuries-old anxiety over the field\u2019s legitimacy
        as an independent and institutionalized scientific discipline.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Germanic

        models</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>This dissertation presents a series of
        observational studies of opposition to immigration (OI) in the European Union.
        A substantial portion of the public seems to prefer a more exclusionary form
        of democracy, but how large, how vocal, and how organized that portion is
        varies considerably. I investigate exclusionism, a dimension of individual
        belief about how extensive political membership should be that tends to reflect
        how denizens prioritize political and cultural aspects of membership. In situating
        exclusionism, I shed light on three puzzles: Which of an individual\u2019s
        concerns are the strongest determinants of OI? Which national developments
        are the strongest determinants of an individual\u2019s OI? How are the effects
        of an individual\u2019s concerns shaped by national context? Exclusionism
        predicts OI in more countries in the EU than do ideology or religion. Post-9/11
        conflicts increase OI but not as dramatically as do increases in the Muslim
        population (suggesting perhaps that Islamophobia outpaces security risks).
        OI is highest in new countries of immigration, but polarization is most pronounced
        in older countries of immigration, where ongoing national developments have
        created unusually large generational gaps, religious differences, and disagreements
        about exclusionism. Political interest is key for explaining large differences
        in opinion, too. Exclusionism increases OI, even in low-immigration countries,
        among individuals with little interest in politics but only slightly; at high
        levels of individual interest and immigration, exclusionism\u2019s effects
        are substantial. My findings reveal major challenges to integration policy
        in high-immigration countries: migrants and natives are unlikely to see eye-to-eye
        at any level of political interest, and there is near complete disagreement
        on immigration policy between politically-interested Muslims and politically-interested
        Christians. Methodologically, I introduce techniques to analyze polarization,
        and my findings have implications for best practices in cross-national survey
        research.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Government</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T17:50:51Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T17:50:51Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-08</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-09-08</dc:date>\n<dc:date>August

        do some shifts in power between states pass off peacefully while others result
        in conflict?  Scholars have debated the implications of international power
        transitions at least since Thucydides in his History of the Peloponnesian
        War documented the rise of Athens and the fear that this aroused in Sparta.
        \ Must the rise in power of a potential challenger lead to jealousy, enmity
        and conflict as Thucydides claims was the case in antiquity?  Or can established
        and rising powers find common ground on the world stage?  Most attempts to
        answer these questions have focused on the decision-making calculus of rising
        states or else have modeled abstract dyadic relations between two rational
        actors under conditions of shifting power.  In this dissertation, I shift
        the analytic focus onto the decision-making of established Great Powers, examining
        the international and domestic-political circumstances under which states
        will acquiesce to or promote the rise of another state and when they will
        instead seek to stymie the rise of a potential rival. The dissertation advances
        the notion that established Great Powers act as critical \u201Cgatekeepers\u201D
        of world order.  In the context of shifting power, established Great Powers
        are by definition materially stronger than their rising challengers\u2014at
        least during the initial phases of a power transition.  As such, established
        Great Powers are able to apply their preponderant power\u2014military, economic,
        political and diplomatic\u2014in ways that shape the opportunity structures
        available to would-be challengers.  I provide an argument to explain when
        and why an established state will see discharge this gatekeeping function
        in a way that is conciliatory towards a rising state and when its leaders
        will, instead, opt for a strategy of containment.  The model has implications
        for reading international history; International Relations theory on grand
        strategy, security studies and international order; and for contemporary public
        policy debates surrounding the rise of China and the other so-called BRICS
        nations.  Evidence is drawn from a comparative historical analysis of British
        and American responses to rising states, 1890-1990.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Government</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T18:02:03Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T18:02:03Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05-18</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        proliferation of nuclear weapons has been a critical concern of the United
        States since World War II. While limiting the spread of nuclear weapons was
        a uniform goal of American administrations, in actual practice, there was
        significant variability in approaches to states as they approached the threshold
        of weaponization or crossed it. Against allied South Korea, America used the
        threat of military abandonment and technology denial to force the country
        to curtail its nuclear ambitions. In the case of a hostile China in the 1960s,
        military threats were the tool of choice. Policy variability cut across the
        ally/opponent divide, encompassing an ambivalent acceptance of non-aligned
        India\u2019s nuclear capabilities by Ford in the 1970s and an acquiescence
        with China\u2019s by Reagan in the 1980s. I argue that explanations based
        purely on the International Structure or Domestic Politics do not sufficiently
        explain these outcomes. I propose a causal mechanism that shapes the U.S.
        response to nuclear proliferation based on two independent variables, \u2018Strategic
        Liability\u2019 and \u2018Commercial Value\u2019. Strategic Liability is rooted
        in the International System, while Commercial Value is rooted in the domestic
        political economy of the U.S. Strategic liability is the Executive\u2019s
        perception of risk from the nuclear program of a particular state, whereas
        Commercial value is the Executive\u2019s estimation of the economic importance
        of that state. I show how these variables act on the American Executive, privileging
        its role in shaping the United States\u2019 response to a state\u2019s attempts
        to develop nuclear weapon capabilities. I posit four policy outcomes based
        on the combination of these independent variables, which take a high or low
        value. I test my argument by analyzing the U.S. response to the four major
        cases noted above, each corresponding to a unique combination of strategic
        liability and commercial value.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Government</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T18:09:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T18:09:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-06-29</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        relationship between Socrates and Alcibiades.  The dynamic Platonic portrait
        of Alcibiades\u2019 changing disposition toward democracy, law, virtue, and
        piety offers insight into the corruptibility of political ambition.  By studying
        it, we can recover a valuable classical point of view on the nature of political
        ambition, especially in its relation to civic-spiritedness on one hand, and
        to the self-serving pursuit of private or political goods on the other.  This
        point of view can in turn be brought to bear upon our own political situation
        as citizens of liberal democracy, with its complex tradition of distrust of
        the political ambitious.  Finally, the question of Socrates\u2019 corruption
        of Alcibiades itself provides invaluable insight into the matter of Socrates\u2019
        own enigmatic philosophic project, which brought him into fatal conflict with
        the city of Athens.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Government</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T18:15:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T18:15:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05-12</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        scholars of comparative judicial politics suggest that judicial autonomy emerges
        from various forms of democratic competition or from a need to assuage the
        concerns of those investing capital in countries controlled by authoritarian
        regimes.  In an authoritarian political system where the Party-State has historically
        sought to monopolize control over judicial selection and promotion, how can
        we explain reforms that increase the degree of merit-based competition, the
        statutory basis of written judicial opinions, the level of court transparency,
        and overall judicial autonomy in courts?  Challenging prevailing theories
        regarding the relationship between economic development and rule of law, I
        argue that the particular patterns of local variation in judicial autonomy
        across urban China can be traced in part to differences in local markets for
        professional legal services: if qualified, mid-ranking judges can easily quit
        their jobs and find lucrative local employment as lawyers, court leaders are
        more likely to strategically reform promotion mechanisms in an attempt to
        retain these young\u2014yet nonetheless, experienced\u2014judges.  These findings
        are based on nearly 15 months of in-country fieldwork, conducted between 2012-2014,
        that included 49 interviews with judges across 3 different case study cities:
        Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Chengdu.  Employing the subnational comparative method,
        this article not only builds theory regarding the emergence of rule of law
        in authoritarian states, it also offers new empirical detail regarding the
        promotion, performance evaluation, and behavior of judges in urban China.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Government</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T18:24:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T18:24:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-06-03</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        from previous scholarship, contemporary policy debates, historical records,
        and 53 interviews with policymaking elites, this dissertation project takes
        a qualitative, field-based approach to expose the internal dynamics of autonomous
        policy subsystems. I contend that these subsystems are characterized by insular,
        expert-based channels of information, specialized media attention, parochial
        interest groups, a politically inactive \u2013 yet advantaged \u2013 target
        population, and an inherent lack of policy conflict. The military personnel
        policy subsystem operationalizes this renewed theory of autonomous policy
        subsystems. From the American Revolution and the Civil War through the first
        and second World Wars and beyond, this dissertation traces the American political
        development of military pension policy though the lens of the policy subsystem,
        documenting the subsystem\u2019s formation, evolution, and ultimate transformation
        into the autonomous military personnel policy subsystem. Through field-based
        interviews of contemporary policy elites, I offer five key findings that contribute
        to the policy subsystems literature. First, high rates of congressional and
        bureaucratic turnover on the military personnel subcommittees and within the
        Pentagon are detrimental to the subsystem\u2019s institutional memory. Second,
        the Pentagon marginalizes itself by stove piping expert information through
        bureaucratic hierarchies leaving it unresponsive to the subsystem\u2019s demands
        for timely information. Third, subsystem actors see a clear distinction between
        power and influence within the subsystem as the congressional subcommittees
        on military personnel wield power and prominent Veterans\u2019 Service Organizations
        wield influence. Fourth, subsystem actors search for and prioritize interinstitutional
        signals from policy elites. Finally, issues surrounding military social policy
        attract a whole new set of competing actors and institutions into the subsystem\u2019s
        policymaking process. Though powerful, autonomous policy subsystems of this
        sort are still susceptible to breakdown and policy change. Beyond exogenous
        shocks and policy entrepreneurs, I contend autonomous policy subsystems are
        particularly vulnerable to jurisdictional threats from blue ribbon commissions
        chartered to gather new information, reframe policy images, alter issue definitions,
        and make policy recommendations. As institutional venues for policy change,
        blue ribbon defense commissions are well-positioned to breakdown autonomous
        policy subsystems and bring about meaningful policy change. The dissertation
        concludes with a broad set of recommendations along with ideas for future
        research agendas.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Government</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T18:56:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T18:56:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-06-29</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        process</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>This dissertation is a study of contagion
        effects in policymaking.  The policy process behaves in many ways like a complex
        system, which is characterized by communication among actors, dynamic interaction,
        and evolution in behavior over time.  As a result, the attention of policy
        elites rapidly jumps from issue to issue as they struggle to address an array
        of pressing issues and problems simultaneously.  I argue that a process of
        issue contagion explains these rapid changes as policy elites are highly interdependent
        actors who are subject to cognitive limits, have incentives to closely monitor
        the political environment, and frequently mimic the behavior of their peers.
        \ Drawing on the methods of computational social science, I build a simulation
        model of agenda-setting behavior and examine issue contagion through an experimental
        research design.  I test the empirical implications of the model by applying
        it to real-world datasets\u2014from the disclosed lobbying activity of organized
        interests to the bill introductions of members of Congress.  The core contribution
        of the project is that patterns in attention to policy issues are a function
        of a contagion process generated by cue-taking behavior among elites.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Government</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T19:03:20Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T19:03:20Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-08</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-07-10</dc:date>\n<dc:date>August

        the role that diplomacy, particularly at the United Nations, played in Namibian
        nationalist and South African imperial policy in the decades following the
        Second World War. My work is based on extensive archival research in Namibia,
        South Africa, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the United States.  I argue
        that the creation of the United Nations out of the ashes of the League of
        Nations gave both Namibians and South Africans hope that they could shape
        Namibia into what they wanted it to be.  Namibians wanted to end the League
        of Nations Mandate that had allowed South Africa to rule their country since
        1920, and the South African government hoped to annex Namibia as the fifth
        province of the Union of South Africa. Namibian nationalists worked with the
        United Nations and other nations to prevent South Africa from gaining legal
        control of Namibia.  Representatives of Namibian nationalists as early as
        1947 began transforming the United Nations away from an institution concerned
        with maintaining empires into a burgeoning anti-colonial force that would
        hasten decolonization.  South Africa, facing decreasing support from the United
        States and Great Britain, desperately tried to reverse the rising tide of
        anti-colonial sentiment that was building at the United Nations.   Both South
        Africans and Namibians viewed the United Nations as the center of the struggle
        over the future of Namibia.  My project examines the strategies and actions
        of both groups as they tried to manipulate world opinion in their favor.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>History</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T19:09:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T19:09:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        history of jazz in Germany between 1918 and 1960. It argues that jazz was
        a multi-sensory cultural object: jazz was never just sound but was fundamentally
        composed of many different media and their respective combinations of sensory
        address. This work follows the major transformations of the perception of
        jazz. During the 1920s, it argues, jazz was primarily a visual and textual
        phenomenon; by 1960, its audience considered sound to be its most important
        attribute and its consumption involved a well-developed hermeneutics of listening.
        As an intersection point for multiple media\u2014it was a subject in newspaper
        articles, books, street advertisements, film, radio, and sound recordings\u2014jazz
        opens a window onto the larger history of media and perception in Germany.
        During the twentieth century, Germany witnessed a shift in its dominant media
        regime. Before the rise of sound film, Germans public communication was dominated
        by images and text; between 1929 and 1940, German society became inundated
        with sound. These media regimes shaped both the contours of perception and
        the form and presence of cultural objects.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>History</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T19:19:12Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T19:19:12Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-08</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2014-09-09</dc:date>\n<dc:date>August

        visual culture</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In January 1957, the Soviet Ministry
        of Culture, assisted by the Union of Journalists, resumed publication of the
        premiere photography journal of the Soviet Union, Sovetskoe Foto after a sixteen
        year hiatus. The relative openness of the Khrushchev period, also known as
        the cultural Thaw, fostered a climate of enthusiasm for photojournalists and
        amateur photographers, who sought to establish photography as an officially
        recognized art form. My dissertation argues that between 1957 and 1962, this
        project seemed achievable; the relative openness of the period offered photojournalists
        the opportunity to discuss their craft and reconceptualize their work in ways
        that had been impossible in previous decades. In response to Khrushchev\u2019s
        denunciation of Stalin in 1956, it is my assertion that the boundaries of
        viable visual representation were shifting, and that a previously outcast
        artistic movement could be reexamined as a way for photojournalists and amateur
        photographers to demonstrate photography\u2019s aesthetic properties. My dissertation
        examines the connections between documentary and aesthetic arguments made
        by Soviet photographers and photojournalists, which complicated the relationship
        between art photography and photojournalism. In the mid-1950s and early 1960s,
        professional photographers returned to these discussions in order to elevate
        their work, make a case for the creation of a union specifically for photographers.
        This occurred at the same time that mass media began to incorporate 1920s
        and 1930s avant-garde aesthetics in press and illustrated magazine photographs,
        making them more accessible to Soviet citizens. The reorientation of Soviet
        life, towards more private contributions to building socialism, as well as
        the government and Party\u2019s interest in expanding and galvanizing the
        press, meant that illustrated magazines were reaching a wider soviet audience.
        After 1962, however, professional and amateur photographers confronted the
        realization that their designs for a photography union and higher education
        were not gaining official support. Photojournalists and theorists at began
        arguing not for photography as an art form, but rather something in between
        art and document. Some amateurs, who had originally desired close correspondence
        with official photographers and photography clubs, began to turn towards unofficial
        and nonconformist photography, severing their ties with the official community.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>History</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T19:25:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T19:25:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-04-22</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        of aspects of public health policy in colonial Ghana from 1900 to the mid-1950s.
        It explains why leprosy a highly debilitating disease condition, did not receive
        any serious attention by the Gold Coast colonial and medical authorities,
        but diseases like yaws and trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) did, although
        the three diseases generally afflicted people of the same geographical location,
        and did not wreck any havoc on the European population. I implicitly challenge
        the interpretations of scholars who frame the argument, based on the notion
        of conceptualizing Africa\u2019s disease environment as an anathema to European
        imperialism and colonization, that colonial public health policy was driven
        by how the African disease environment affected the lives of both official
        and non-official Europeans in the colonies.  I argue that the thinking of
        the Gold Coast colonial and medical authorities on the disease environment
        was not a static one. By the mid-1930s the disease was conceptualized as an
        exploitable resource.  Medical and pharmaceutical research became important,
        as were markets for pharmaceutical products.  The welfare of the colonial
        economy, which was labor driven was at play and so was the cultural image
        of the superiority of anything European. Leprosy was not an appropriate disease
        for experiment purposes and because the healing process of lepers who were
        treated by European medication was not spontaneous it challenged the notions
        of cultural and material superiority being bandied around. Leprosy did not
        also affect the labor pool of the cocoa and mineral industries.  Leprosy was
        essentially abandoned for trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and yaws which
        threatened not just the numbers, but also the quality of labor pool for the
        cocoa and mineral industries.  The two disease offered appropriate avenues
        for extensive medical and pharmaceutical research. The trial medications deployed
        showed spontaneous improvement on patients and that bolstered both the notions
        of medical and cultural superiority and the urge for western pharmacopeia.
        To ensure the full exploitation of this emerging pharmaceutical market, colonial
        government was relentless in suffocating the professions of African herbal
        practitioners.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>History</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T19:49:14Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T19:49:14Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        is well-documented that sports appropriation is universal, though the degree
        varies from place to place.  The emergence of sports in Nigeria provides insights
        into evolving construction of ethnicity, class, and gender, while simultaneously
        speaking to local ideas about identity and modernity. For many in Africa,
        sports clearly represent a passion and pleasure.  Two overarching questions
        guide this dissertation: why were Western sports introduced to Nigeria by
        the colonial government and missionaries? What role did sports play in processes
        of identity creation, urban development and modernization in Nigeria? These
        questions establish the human agency involved within the creation of sporting
        activities and allow room for the motivations of actors. I answer these questions
        by examining the broad significance of sports in Nigeria through the stadium.
        The debates over stadium construction in advance of Nigeria\u2019s independence
        revealed the ways in which sports critically shaped the conceptions of urban
        planning and national health in the nation. Although fifty years will be covered
        here, I focus more on the 1960 to 1980 period in accordance with this dissertation\u2019s
        emphasis on stadium space and the modernity of leisure. This work shows how
        spectators used the stadium to construct patronage networks and alliances,
        and how the government used the stadium as a mobilizing force to legitimize
        their activities at the grassroots and national levels. In this dissertation,
        I read the stadium as a representation of power, authority and discipline\u2014the
        work of architects, politicians, bureaucrats, journalists, and sports officials\u2014and
        as a venue of lived experiences of spectators, who redefined the stadium in
        terms that, while not always their own choosing, demonstrated the incorporation
        of the stadium into everyday life and processes of identity formation in Nigeria.
        I argue that sports, and the spaces in which they unfolded, dramatically shaped
        society, politics and culture in Nigeria. I argue that through sport competitions,
        Nigeria became fixed in the national consciousness as modern.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>History</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T19:54:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T19:54:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-06-24</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        work is a modern history of Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province,
        from the late nineteenth to mid twentieth centuries.  The story begins by
        discussing a battle that occurred in the city during the Taiping Rebellion
        (1850-1864), a civil war that erupted in China during the mid nineteenth century.
        \ The events of this battle, but especially its memorialization in local temples
        in the years following the rebellion, established a local identity of resistance
        to Christianity and western imperialism.  By the 1890\u2019s this culture
        of resistance contributed to a series of riots that erupted in south China,
        related to the distribution of anti-Christian tracts and placards from publishing
        houses in Changsha.  During these years a local gentry named Ye Dehui (1864-1927)
        emerged as a prominent businessman, grain merchant, and community leader.
        \ When a massive urban riot erupted in April 1910, Ye and other gentry were
        accused of withholding grain from starving peasants and other disgruntled
        locals.  At the end of the same decade, in 1919 the Treaty of Versailles ended
        the war in Europe but awarded German owned territory in north China to Japan.
        \ Students and activists erupted in protest in cities throughout China, especially
        in Changsha.  The climate of urban activism that emerged by the 1920\u2019s
        inaugurated an age of civic identity in the city.  Activists embraced certain
        ideas associated with western modernity\u2014such as Marxism\u2014in order
        to overcome western imperialism.  Among the voices of dissent were young activists
        such as Mao Zedong (1893-1976).  Students from foreign missionary schools
        even joined the protests.  This new generation of activists published articles
        in the local press and other journals denouncing the West\u2019s influence
        not only in Changsha, but also in communities throughout China. I also discuss
        the history of women in Changsha, most notably the experiences of an activist
        named Zhu Tierong (1915-2009).  During World War II she worked with the local
        chapter of the YMCA to care for refugees.  The war also brought intense carnage
        to Changsha, as much of the city was destroyed by a fire in 1938.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>History</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T20:01:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T20:01:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-05-20</dc:date>\n<dc:date>May

        in the 1960's, mainline Protestantism saw rates of participation begin to
        slip. As this trend has continued to follow a downward slope over recent decades,
        social scientific researchers on religion have been interested in this pattern
        of decline. As such, research has examined many diverse factors contributing
        to this pattern of mainline decline, including cultural, ecological, and demographic.
        However, amidst all the literature on \"mainline decline,\" rarely have researchers
        considered the factors that have allowed the mainline to subsist. These factors
        are most likely neither demographic nor macro-level cultural forces. Instead,
        they are local elements of the church's organization and culture which are
        forged on a congregational level. As mainline churches confront dwindling
        participating rates and resources, they must learn to work within the contemporary
        context of religious pluralism and individualism to find ways of reinjecting
        the religious experience with salient meaning. This study looks at a Presbyterian
        church in-decline as it does just this, reinventing its identity and rearranging
        its organization to meet the needs of its members.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Sociology</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T20:47:18Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T20:47:18Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:type>text</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>doi:10.15781/T2V016</dc:identifier>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2152/31459</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>eng</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>UT

        descriptive research study examines the connection and communication between
        art education researchers and practicing art teachers regarding the current
        trend of postmodernism in art education. It was established in this study
        that the world of art and consequently art education has experienced a shift
        in trends from modernism to postmodernism. The intent of this study was to
        discern what art education researchers are suggesting for a postmodern curriculum
        design, and further to learn through interviews and observations what and
        how public school art teachers understand, interpret and implement postmodern
        curriculum content in the art classroom. The researcher unearthed a great
        discontinuity between art education theorists and practicing art teachers
        and concludes this is a subject of study that needs to be rectified if art
        education is to establish itself as a meaningful part of schooling and students'
        lives.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Art Education</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T21:06:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-09-29T21:06:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:type>Thesis</dc:type>\n<dc:type>text</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>doi:10.15781/T2Q59Q</dc:identifier>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2152/31460</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>eng</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>UT
