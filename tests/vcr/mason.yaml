        \ is conventional in labor economics to treat all workers who are seeking\
        \ new jobs as belonging to a labor pool, and all firms that have job vacancies\
        \ as an employer pool, and then match workers to jobs. Here we develop a new\
        \ approach to study labor and firm dynamics. By combining the emerging science\
        \ of networks with newly available employment micro-data, comprehensive at\
        \ the level of whole countries, we are able to broadly characterize the process\
        \ through which workers move between firms. Specifically, for each firm in\
        \ an economy as a node in a graph, we draw edges between firms if a worker\
        \ has migrated between them, possibly with a spell of unemployment in between.\
        \ An economy's overall graph of firm-worker interactions is an object we call\
        \ the labor flow network (LFN). This is the first study that characterizes\
        \ a LFN for an entire economy. We explore the properties of this network,\
        \ including its topology, its community structure, and its relationship to\
        \ economic variables. It is shown that LFNs can be useful in identifying firms\
        \ with high growth potential. We relate LFNs to other notions of high performance\
        \ firms. Specifically, it is shown that fewer than 10% of firms account for\
        \ nearly 90% of all employment growth. We conclude with a model in which empirically-salient\
        \ LFNs emerge from the interaction of heterogeneous adaptive agents in a decentralized\
        \ labor market.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Publication of this article\

        \ are one of the most structurally and functionally diverse cell types found\
        \ in nature, owing in large part to their unique class specific dendritic\
        \ architectures. Dendrites, being highly specialized in receiving and processing\
        \ neuronal signals, play a key role in the formation of functional neural\
        \ circuits. Hence, in order to understand the emergence and assembly of a\
        \ complex nervous system, it is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms\
        \ that direct class specific dendritogenesis.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nMethodology/Principal\
        \ Findings&#xd;\n&#xd;\nWe have used the Drosophila dendritic arborization\
        \ (da) neurons to gain systems-level insight into dendritogenesis by a comparative\
        \ study of the morphologically distinct Class-I (C-I) and Class-IV (C-IV)\
        \ da neurons. We have used a combination of cell-type specific transcriptional\
        \ expression profiling coupled to a targeted and systematic in vivo RNAi functional\
        \ validation screen. Our comparative transcriptomic analyses have revealed\
        \ a large number of differentially enriched/depleted gene-sets between C-I\
        \ and C-IV neurons, including a broad range of molecular factors and biological\
        \ processes such as proteolytic and metabolic pathways. Further, using this\
        \ data, we have identified and validated the role of 37 transcription factors\
        \ in regulating class specific dendrite development using in vivo class-specific\
        \ RNAi knockdowns followed by rigorous and quantitative neurometric analysis.&#xd;\n\
        &#xd;\nConclusions/Significance&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThis study reports the first\
        \ global gene-expression profiles from purified Drosophila C-I and C-IV da\
        \ neurons. We also report the first large-scale semi-automated reconstruction\
        \ of over 4,900 da neurons, which were used to quantitatively validate the\
        \ RNAi screen phenotypes. Overall, these analyses shed global and unbiased\
        \ novel insights into the molecular differences that underlie the morphological\
        \ diversity of distinct neuronal cell-types. Furthermore, our class-specific\
        \ gene expression datasets should prove a valuable community resource in guiding\
        \ further investigations designed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying\
        \ class specific neuronal patterning.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The\

        <dc:subject>Mauritia flexuosa</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Background&#xd;\n\
        &#xd;\nFruit from the palm Mauritia flexuosa (aguaje) is harvested throughout\
        \ the Peruvian Amazon for subsistence and commercial purposes. Recent estimates\
        \ suggest that residents of Iquitos, the largest city in the region, consume\
        \ approximately 148.8 metric tons of aguaje fruit per month, the vast majority\
        \ of which is harvested by felling and killing adult female trees. In this\
        \ study, we sought to better understand and document the importance of M.\
        \ flexuosa palm swamps (aguajales) in two Maijuna indigenous communities to\
        \ inform the sustainable management of this habitat and species.&#xd;\n&#xd;\n\
        Methods&#xd;\n&#xd;\nSemi-structured interviews, focus groups, and household\
        \ surveys were carried out to assess the significance of aguajales and their\
        \ associated plant and animal resources as well as to determine how the relationship\
        \ that the Maijuna have with aguajales has changed over time.&#xd;\n&#xd;\n\
        Results&#xd;\n&#xd;\nAguajales and their associated resources are culturally\
        \ significant and useful to the Maijuna in a wide variety of ways. In addition\
        \ to M. flexuosa, the Maijuna use over 60 different species of plants from\
        \ aguajales. When M. flexuosa is in fruit, aguajales are important hunting\
        \ areas with a total of 20 different animal species hunted. The Maijuna also\
        \ have traditional beliefs about aguajales, believing that malevolent supernatural\
        \ beings reside in them. Notably, the relationship that the Maijuna have with\
        \ aguajales has changed considerably over the years as aguaje fruit went from\
        \ a subsistence item collected opportunistically from the ground to a market\
        \ good destructively harvested beginning in the early 1990s. The Maijuna are\
        \ concerned not only about how this has affected the future commercial harvest\
        \ of aguaje but also about its effects on game animals given the importance\
        \ of hunting to Maijuna cultural identity, subsistence, and income generation.&#xd;\n\
        &#xd;\nConclusions&#xd;\n&#xd;\nIn order to meet the multiple socio-cultural\
        \ and economic needs of the Maijuna, sustainable management efforts must be\
        \ expanded to not only focus on the commercial harvest of aguaje but also\
        \ other facets of their relationship with this habitat. Our study suggests\
        \ that the research and development of multi-use forest management plans must\
        \ not be restricted to commercial forest products and ecosystem services given\
        \ that many communities rely on tropical forests for a wide range of non-market\
        \ cultural, economic, and subsistence goods and services.</dc:description>\n\

        \ call into question the role of menthol in nicotine addiction. To date, a\
        \ biological basis for the high rate of addiction and relapse among menthol\
        \ cigarette smokers has not been defined. Studies have demonstrated a role\
        \ for menthol in the metabolism of nicotine in the body. More recent findings\
        \ now reveal an interaction between menthol and the nicotinic acetylcholine\
        \ (nACh) receptor in cells. This receptor is central to the actions of nicotine\
        \ in the brain, and plays an important role in nicotine addiction. The newly\
        \ discovered effect of menthol on nACh receptors may begin to explain the\
        \ unique addictive properties of menthol cigarettes.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This\

        <dc:description>Constructivist learning theory contends that we construct\
        \ knowledge by experience and that environmental context influences learning.\
        \ To explore this principle, we examined the cognitive process relational\
        \ complexity (RC), defined as the number of visual dimensions considered during\
        \ problem solving on a matrix reasoning task and a well-documented measure\
        \ of mature reasoning capacity. We sought to determine how the visual environment\
        \ influences RC by examining the influence of color and visual contrast on\
        \ RC in a neuroimaging task. To specify the contributions of sensory demand\
        \ and relational integration to reasoning, our participants performed a non-verbal\
        \ matrix task comprised of color, no-color line, or black-white visual contrast\
        \ conditions parametrically varied by complexity (relations 0, 1, 2). The\
        \ use of matrix reasoning is ecologically valid for its psychometric relevance\
        \ and for its potential to link the processing of psychophysically specific\
        \ visual properties with various levels of RC during reasoning. The role of\
        \ these elements is important because matrix tests assess intellectual aptitude\
        \ based on these seemingly context-less exercises. This experiment is a first\
        \ step toward examining the psychophysical underpinnings of performance on\
        \ these types of problems. The importance of this is increased in light of\
        \ recent evidence that intelligence can be linked to visual discrimination.\
        \ We submit three main findings. First, color and black-white visual contrast\
        \ (BWVC) add demand at a basic sensory level, but contributions from color\
        \ and from BWVC are dissociable in cortex such that color engages a \u201C\
        reasoning heuristic\u201D and BWVC engages a \u201Csensory heuristic.\u201D\
        \ Second, color supports contextual sense-making by boosting salience resulting\
        \ in faster problem solving. Lastly, when visual complexity reaches 2-relations,\
        \ color and visual contrast relinquish salience to other dimensions of problem\
        \ solving.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Salary support for M. Layne Kalbfleisch\

        Successful management of chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)\
        \ infection with a cocktail of antiretroviral medications can be negatively\
        \ affected by the presence of drug resistant mutations in the viral targets.\
        \ These targets include the HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase\
        \ (RT) proteins, for which a number of inhibitors are available on the market\
        \ and routinely prescribed. Protein mutational patterns are associated with\
        \ varying degrees of resistance to their respective inhibitors, with extremes\
        \ that can range from continued susceptibility to cross-resistance across\
        \ all drugs.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nResults&#xd;\nHere we implement statistical learning\
        \ algorithms to develop structure- and sequence-based models for systematically\
        \ predicting the effects of mutations in the PR and RT proteins on resistance\
        \ to each of eight and eleven inhibitors, respectively. Employing a four-body\
        \ statistical potential, mutant proteins are represented as feature vectors\
        \ whose components quantify relative environmental perturbations at amino\
        \ acid residue positions in the respective target structures upon mutation.\
        \ Two approaches are implemented in developing sequence-based models, based\
        \ on use of either relative frequencies or counts of n-grams, to generate\
        \ vectors for representing mutant proteins. To the best of our knowledge,\
        \ this is the first reported study on structure- and sequence-based predictive\
        \ models of HIV-1 PR and RT drug resistance developed by implementing a four-body\
        \ statistical potential and n-grams, respectively, to generate mutant attribute\
        \ vectors. Performance of the learning methods is evaluated on the basis of\
        \ tenfold cross-validation, using previously assayed and publicly available\
        \ in vitro data relating mutational patterns in the targets to quantified\
        \ inhibitor susceptibility changes.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nConclusion&#xd;\nOverall\
        \ performance results are competitive with those of a previously published\
        \ study utilizing a sequence-based strategy, while our structure- and sequence-based\
        \ models provide orthogonal and complementary prediction methodologies, respectively.\
        \ In a novel application, we describe a technique for identifying every possible\
        \ pair of RT inhibitors as either potentially effective together as part of\
        \ a cocktail, or a combination that is to be avoided.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Publication\

        \ illustrated the importance of the microbiota in maintaining a healthy state,\
        \ as well as promoting disease states. The intestinal microbiota exerts its\
        \ effects primarily through its metabolites, and metabolomics investigations\
        \ have begun to evaluate the diagnostic and health implications of volatile\
        \ organic compounds (VOCs) isolated from human feces, enabled by specialized\
        \ sampling methods such as headspace solid-phase microextraction (hSPME).\
        \ The approach to stool sample collection is an important consideration that\
        \ could potentially introduce bias and affect the outcome of a fecal metagenomic\
        \ and metabolomic investigation. To address this concern, a comparison of\
        \ endoscopically collected (in vivo) and home collected (ex vivo) fecal samples\
        \ was performed, revealing slight variability in the derived microbiomes.\
        \ In contrast, the VOC metabolomes differ widely between the home collected\
        \ and endoscopy collected samples. Additionally, as the VOC extraction profile\
        \ is hyperbolic, with short extraction durations more vulnerable to variation\
        \ than extractions continued to equilibrium, a second goal of our investigation\
        \ was to ascertain if hSPME-based fecal metabolomics studies might be biased\
        \ by the extraction duration employed. As anticipated, prolonged extraction\
        \ (18 hours) results in the identification of considerably more metabolites\
        \ than short (20 minute) extractions. A comparison of the metabolomes reveals\
        \ several analytes deemed unique to a cohort with the 20 minute extraction,\
        \ but found common to both cohorts when the VOC extraction was performed for\
        \ 18 hours. Moreover, numerous analytes perceived to have significant fold\
        \ change with a 20 minute extraction were found insignificant in fold change\
        \ with the prolonged extraction, underscoring the potential for bias associated\
        \ with a 20 minute hSPME.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This study was\

        \ of human tissues typically yield as results the gene lists comprised of\
        \ a mix of relevant molecular entities with multiple false positives that\
        \ obstruct the translation of such results into mechanistic hypotheses. From\
        \ general probabilistic considerations, gene lists distilled for the mechanistically\
        \ relevant components can be far more useful for subsequent experimental design\
        \ or data interpretation.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nResults&#xd;\nThe input candidate gene\
        \ lists were processed into different tiers of evidence consistency established\
        \ by enrichment analysis across subsets of the same experiments and across\
        \ different experiments and platforms. The cut-offs were established empirically\
        \ through ontological and semantic enrichment; resultant shortened gene list\
        \ was re-expanded by Ingenuity Pathway Assistant tool. The resulting sub-networks\
        \ provided the basis for generating mechanistic hypotheses that were partially\
        \ validated by literature search. This approach differs from previous consistency-based\
        \ studies in that the cut-off on the Receiver Operating Characteristic of\
        \ the true-false separation process is optimized by flexible selection of\
        \ the consistency building procedure. The gene list distilled by this analytic\
        \ technique and its network representation were termed Compact Disease Model\
        \ (CDM). Here we present the CDM signature for the study of early-stage Alzheimer\u2019\
        s disease. The integrated analysis of this gene signature allowed us to identify\
        \ the protein traffic vesicles as prominent players in the pathogenesis of\
        \ Alzheimer\u2019s. Considering the distances and complexity of protein trafficking\
        \ in neurons, it is plausible that spontaneous protein misfolding along with\
        \ a shortage of growth stimulation result in neurodegeneration. Several potentially\
        \ overlapping scenarios of early-stage Alzheimer pathogenesis have been discussed,\
        \ with an emphasis on the protective effects of AT-1 mediated antihypertensive\
        \ response on cytoskeleton remodeling, along with neuronal activation of oncogenes,\
        \ luteinizing hormone signaling and insulin-related growth regulation, forming\
        \ a pleiotropic model of its early stages. Alignment with emerging literature\
        \ confirmed many predictions derived from early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2019\
        \ CDM.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nConclusions&#xd;\nA flexible approach for high-throughput\
        \ data analysis, the Compact Disease Model generation, allows extraction of\
        \ meaningful, mechanism-centered gene sets compatible with instant translation\
        \ of the results into testable hypotheses.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Publication\
